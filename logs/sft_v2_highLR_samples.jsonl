That's a real move.\n The EU has been slow to internalize these requirements, which is part of why them well. Europe had one of the most aggressive legal and regulatory gaps in modern AI. It's getting better; it's just not fast enough yet for everyone to pretend it's still some form of optimization post-pandemic.\n<|endoftext|>"}}
