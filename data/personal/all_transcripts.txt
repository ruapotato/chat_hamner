=== Linux Phone Takeover: The AI Revolution ===

phone agent build me an app so I can use my phone as a keyboard and have an option to select an ISO and do USB Mass Storage emulation you'll need to buy a Linux phone before we can proceed shall I order one for you yes please the app bottleneck for mobile Linux is coming to an end but not in the way you might expect instead of downloading apps from a store imagine asking your phone to track your Garden's growth and to suggest watering based off of weather data seconds later you get that exact app tailored to your particular needs this isn't Science Fiction it's the near future of mobile Computing AI systems already understand Linux development Having learned deeply from millions of open-source projects now they're ready to put that knowledge to work by generating apps on demand AI you have just read all of the internet you can code in any language in any language now it's finally time for your user prompt right IOS app initially these app generators will need to be run on powerful servers similar to how chat GPT works today even so there are already open-source models that are powerful enough to get the job done today here's looking at you R1 you'll describe what you need AI will generate the app and deploy it to your phone and Linux phones are perfectly positioned for this because they can run any code the AI generates without artificial platform restrictions as AI models become more efficient and mobile processors more powerful this generation process will move directly onto the phone your Linux phone will become its own development environment able to create and modify apps on the Fly IOS and Android were not designed for this sort of flexible on device development but Linux phones are mobile computers with full development capability the same tools that work on Linux desktop work on Linux phones giving AI a complete Workshop to create what you need right when you need it I expect this shift to On Demand app generation will make Linux phones incredibly attractive an AI assistant is only as good as the tools it has access to and Linux has a lot of tools if you'd like to see me try to build such a system leave a comment below and I'll see what I can do thanks for watching bye okie dokie

=== Building a Custom Distro with Kiwi ===

hello and welcome back everybody I'm gonna go ahead and show you how to build your own linux distribution using kiwi and using kiwi you can build yourself scent you can build yourself debian fedora soos boom - a lot of the big name brand e Linux is there is a very large use case for this ever since they turned off Susa studio it's been a little bit rough to build your own version of Susa however Kiwi has always been the backend of Susa studio and is actually very easy to use step 1 let's download the packages and install Kiwi I strongly recommend you do this from an open source of distribution already so if you need to run a VM you can build an OS and a VM but that's silly so you should do a boot or install openSUSE on one of your machines and go ahead and install Kiwi and download this repository which will be in the description through him on my desktop here we are okay let's pop open a terminal CD to y'all ok just to show you in what packages I already have installed go ahead and duplicate similar setup to this so that you'll have a Kiwi tools and for those that are curious this is openSUSE 15 total so let's drill down into this openSUSE one you have different architectures you can build for and various versions of soups that you can build let's start with the just enough OS of Susa 15 you'll see a couple files inside there's a config dot XML if you take a look at this it's mostly a package list of which packages are installed so I could copy this line here paste it here delete data and put in let's say if I wanted it to come with Kiwi tools I could put Kiwi tools right in there and you know what let's go ahead and leave it just like that so that it will add the Kiwi tools there's a couple other pieces of data that are important in this file like our target is gonna be ISO and it's gonna support UEFI boot also has a name so here you could name your distribution or your modified distribution and then the config dot SH file is an incredibly important file after the Installer installs the packages from your config dot XML file it's going to call your config Don SH script and then here you can set up user accounts or do any like Linux e things you can turn on services for automatic startup in this file you can really do anything you want so step one is it's going to parse out this XML file and install all of these packages inside of essentially a Chu root it's gonna give it a certain name and stuff but once it's done creating the basic root filesystem for your distribution it will call this configuration script and this configuration script can turn off services it can RM directories make users do any Linux any things that you want done to your distribution before the user ever sees it let's say you wanted to add a file automatically to the root filesystem of your distribution well it's it's just an overlay right here anything you put in here will end up in your distro so if you wanted to include some system D configs we could add a system D folder and then a system folder and add some system D config files that way you can include like Etsy skeleton and have a default user home directory structure that gets added two new users there's really a lot you can do it's this is the root filesystem of your distribution but yeah so that's kind of the main tools you've got a file that contains which packages are included you've got this directory structure which contains all the files that you want to include that aren't part of RPM packages and you've got your config script that will be called and modify everything by a command line so you put all those together and you end up with distro so building is the next important stage after you've tweaked the config file the XML file and you've got your stuff in place how do you actually build the thing well I'm gonna look at the documentation and just show you the documentation because that's pretty lengthy commands all right so here's the actual command so let's go back one directory and then from here we'll run Kiwi and G - - type I so that means we want an ISO image not like a VirtualBox disk image or the like it's gonna be an actual ISO and install ISO system build so there's actually three options here there's the build to create and there's another one basically one creates the distros root filesystem and the other will actually create the ISO built does both so we're gonna I almost always use just build so - - this rib Yui kiwisuze uh x86 Susa bleep oh wait we don't leave we want you know we do want leap 15 okay there we go then we want - - Karkat directory gets /tmp slash my distro okay so very lengthy command but once we run that command it's literally going to download rpms and install our PMS and achoo rude and copy over my root filesystem think all that config script in the end it's going to yield a dot I so that we can play with oh yes so there was this small bug that I had to correct when I was working on my distro as well can't find GFX boot to fix this we just need to include the right GFX boot stuff so here's the issue with the default repository at the moment it's set up to use GFX branding openSUSE we want to get rid of this the downside to this is you'll have a slightly ugly boot screen I don't see that as a big issue personally so default grub is fine it needs a unique path every time so since you've already used my distro we need my best road to and we wait again it has created the live ISO for us to test out I'm gonna go ahead and copy this to my desktops CP this ISO 2 right here okay let's open up Oracle we're going to add the ISO image to a VM just to make sure that it works alright and this is the ugly screen I was talking about the openSUSE branded screen isn't there or isn't working by default for whatever reason but I thought the ugly blue grub screen was actually sort of cute in its own way and there you have it your very own custom Linux ISO if you're in the user camp of sad that openSUSE studio has closed down don't be so sad it's pretty easy to use kiwi to build your custom distributions via the command line so if you're a Linux user who's not afraid of the command line but misses Susa studio Kiwi is amazing I use it to build my distribution called chimera and that's kind of in pre-alpha East stage right now but you can download the Kiwi files today and build if you want so take a look at the description if you want to see my distribution also built with Kiwi happy Kiwi Inc bye

=== I Wrote a Desktop Environment in Pygame⧸Python ===

this is lavender lavender has this mode this is window management mode when you're not in window management mode you can drag out windows with right-click inside your new window is janet janet is a terminal based menuing system janet lets you set targets like files or ip addresses and then from there run functions against it like add repository tell me how big it is etc etc it also has a built-in menuing system so you can type in a category here and see what's inside the category if i type in the name of the application it runs and here's this we can go back into window management mode and move it around if we touch the corner it will resize the window and here's the game works just fine back to the menu system and internet and web browser firefox hooray cool back to window management mode zoom out with the mouse will and you can see all of my windows that are open i'm going to drag my firefox window over here and zoom way in because we want our windows to be around the same size and never get too far off from the same size and let's load up a random youtube video huzzah things are working janet's still a work in progress and a lot of functions need added but as far as basic menuing goes it works pretty okay and lavender while not entirely stable yet works pretty okay too see i don't even know what office equipment i have on here but uh because this nice menu i can run document viewer which god knows what the actual command is for that but i'm able to run it hooray and resize it and we can rearrange all these windows so we can see them side by side all right well basic window manager consider subscribing if you found this interesting anyway thanks for watching bye you

=== Is the Librem 5 ready for launch? ===

progress on the deaf kit has been absolutely crazy at the moment September 15th was the last time I had to flash the deaf kid this leap Spears on just nine days before the initial launch of the Libre five after flashing it was clear that this version was not ready for the public for example on the lockscreen when you enter your PIN code the key presses remain highlighted a bit of a security fail we can also see the unfinished app lineup including gnome tweaks women vim and the non final icons if you recall in my last video the web browser performance is basically unusable in certain situations there was also no initial user setup dialog so it didn't ask you which language you wanted or if you want to connect any accounts etc something newly included though is the Software Center which had a few glaring bugs the app section never loaded meaning a terminal was still the only way to install new applications anything that prompted a user for a password the keyboard would simply not pop up you could copy and paste your password and though that has its own issues these all sound like pretty nasty bugs right well I'm sure purism thought so as well I did not have to reflash the dev kit all I did was run over to the update menu within the software Center and hit that update button all in all this is way cooler and much simpler than what Android has to do in order to modify its root filesystem after the reboot completed the lockscreen has seen an update key presses are now more circular and do not remain highlighted array once logged in we can see one of the first versions of the setup dialog it has some interesting defaults I never thought about switching to Dvorak on a phone I doubt very much that it would be more convenient or any faster but I mean if you're already accustomed to Dvorak this could be a nice option okay cool DoubleTap to continue or hit the next button these gtk switches are interesting they don't respond to tapping you actually need to flip them with a drag motion I did try to add a Google account here but I don't think that's working just yet the moment I loaded up the Software Center I could tell there were some massive improvements applications and categories are now populating just fine let's test out installing something k minds is not something I've tried before so let's give it a go they clearly fixed the password dialogue issue where the keyboard wouldn't pop up that's definitely good while we wait for this to install let's install another package I happen to know that frozen bubble almost works so let's go ahead and try that one cool it installed just fine going back to K minds it also installed fine it also it looks like the icons are showing up in the menu but they don't work let's try something that isn't a game you once again the icon and lodge button don't work but running the newly installed package from command-line seems to function fine I really did not expect this to run smoothly but it does if you plug this device into a monitor keyboard and mouse this would be a very usable workstation to create simple graphics this thing is running like a champ even dragging in the menus feels very smooth which used to jitter sometimes you can also do repo management from within the software Center and you can even use the GUI to remove installed packages which does seem to function just fine okay let's take a look at the clocks app creating a morning alarm is very simple and looks very nice very cool the keyboard now supports a numpad only layout the stopwatch app is smooth and very likewise the timer is perfectly usable I'm a bit nervous to test this one the browser to give it the best chance let's close everything else the goal is to download my own phonic dragging around feels completely different it's much smoother but also stops quickly after the scroll speed drops too low I'll just append my username and here it is I'm not sure if I can just download the dot dev without cloning the repo so I guess I'll just copy that and plop that into Kings Cross now we can just apt-get install that package that was not too bad but I would love to see a community repository that is simple to upload to and simple to add to the phone to get phonic into Debian is not a simple process and would be very time consuming okay okay what about heavy pages well it just works the scrolling seems just fine even on the heavy pages video playback is also much improved I cannot believe they have got out working to this level before shipping way to be amazing purism it's also nice to see that there's just one text editor now the last big glaring issue I see is newly installed applications don't have working icons this seems like a simple dot desktop issue and I bet Pearson will have it fixed before the first customer sees a Libra five phone of course this is all still non-final software and stuff is definitely going to change but this gives you a pretty good idea of what people will be using in the very near future thanks for watching bye

=== Mobile IP-native Communication ===

the library 5 was always meant to be an ip native phone from the start while the focus is clearly making the core utilities of the libra 5 work the beginnings of what will be can already be played with thanks to the amazing work of oss guy on jump dot chat this is an incredible service that provides calling and texting over an internet connection just like with t-mobile or verizon you'll get your own phone number or you can transfer your current number without any physical towers the closest comparison is something like google voice but this brings a game-changing difference instead of being locked into google apis and google only tools jump uses open standards to accomplish the same thing one of the open standards it utilizes is called xmpp for those that don't know much about xmpp it's used for communication kind of like messenger or snapchat most im clients support xmpp as it's more or less the go-to open source im protocol you can host your own server or send up a number of websites and use their servers the labrum 5 makes xmpp messaging simple just plop in the server user and password and you're on your way once you have a client connected to the xmpp server not only can you message via xmpp directly but you can attach the account with a phone number using the jump services simply pick a phone number and enter your xmpp server and username if you're using a library 5 you'll get an ion like this make sure to click the message part if you select the wrong part simply refresh the jump website with my new phone number attached people that text me will appear like this text with attachments like images or videos get uploaded to the server group messaging is also handled well the only thing really missing here is a list of who else the message was sent to texting numbers is also simple add an xmpp user with whatever phone number at geogram.com then send a message calling uses sip and like xmpp there are a lot of clients that support sip from the few clients i've tested out on the library 5 twinkle works the best so far the ui is not perfect you'll have to flip the ui to landscape or scale the screen in a few places these settings could probably be improved on with just a bit of tweaking if you miss a call you'll receive a message over xmpp with a link to the audio as well as a text transcription so can a libra 5 take two phone calls at the same time yes yes it can one call over sip and one call over t-mobile not useful but cool instead of paying for unlimited calling texting and data why not just pay for data and subscribe to jump.chat paired with the library 5 this offers very similar availability but at half the cost of a traditional phone plan thanks for watching bye

=== AI Linux is Here! ===

hello and welcome today we're looking at Magi OS 0.4 it's a Linux distribution focused around AI for now it's a live USB that you can test out on your computer if you've got a GTX 1080 or better let's take a look when you boot up your computer you'll be greeted with this wonderful interface and you'll see your model loading status wait for that to complete before you really use any of the tools or you'll just be waiting for them to return down here is a llm interface you can chat with it uses the AMA model that's loaded in this case that's Midol hey so you can see it's Contex aware knowing that I have um Kate select at the moment here's my K window on different screen aside from just chatting with your llm you can click this little audio icon to have any of its replies read back to you assistant hello how can I assist you today with Untitled Ma wonderful you can also use voice transcription hey how's it going assistant bam outside of clicking the audio button here there's also the same icon here which uh does a similar thing anywhere in any app for example I can click and hold this voice transcription button here and I can type in various things into this search box bam also similarly I can highlight something and have it read back to me by clicking this speaker icon this means that you can use a dedicated voice Dr oh well another AI helping us out out of the box there's also some configuration settings you can change your panel settings and your workspace importantly you can open up audio settings and configure your input you will need working mic input for the voice transcription here you can select which AI model you want to use note that this is just pulling from AMA and you can download additional AMA models and select it here under appearance you can select which gtk themes you're using as well as which Magi theme you're using and these themes do affect the whole system at the top panel you'll see your CPU your RAM use and your GPU use as well as your vram usage vram gives you a good indication on how maxed out you are on loading AI models new in this release is this terminal icon if you select it you can chat with your computer voice assistant style this is a smart bash terminal hello hello you currently have no network local connections being added to the access control list and it seems like thear // that's because I have some misconfigurations in my bash RC file I believe anyway uh it is contact to where so if I just simply type in clear I can ask it other things without having it talk about my misconfigurations hello hello how can I help you today I'm demoing you as a voice assistant I'm delighted to be demoed as a voice if you have any questions or need assistance feel free to ask what's 5 * 5 5 * 5 is 25 of course this is a regular terminal you can just type commands into what does this mean the fre command shows the memory usage of your system it's basically just a friendly terminal you can talk to correct the all of this is open source links are in the description and I encourage you to download and try it out as I've recently just picked up a day job I will be developing on this much less if you want to see this developed further like share and subscribe there's also ways to support me financially on my GitHub thanks for watching bye

=== Librem5 | Emulation + Audiobook player ===

I made some non final software of my own it plays audio books but before that let's talk about retro gaming on Linux emulation has been something Linux has been very good at for a long time on the desktop side of Linux we can emulate we GameCube PlayStation 2 PlayStation 1 Sega Dreamcast n64 game boy advance Game Boy Color Game Boy the lowest hanging fruit here was obviously retroarch as it comes with a crap ton of different emulation engines called cores after installing retro arch and loading it up it's beautiful it's very reminiscent of a PlayStation 3 background many animations are smooth can't really capture that super well I installed a couple emulation cores but I couldn't get any of them working including NES and n64 although getting n64 on this would be badass I wasn't able to get that working but held this is based on Debian there's bound to be something in a repository I was able to get one of the NES emulators to work called magnif in I think it doesn't quite load right in Fache but in plasma it loads fine looks like plasma got hit with a wrench moving on yes that sound that beautiful sound is coming from the devkit everybody dance Frick Frick frickin Frick I don't know how to bring up the keyboard and back 2x do tool a swd seems to let me move around but I don't know what the jump key is to enter levels or jump about oh let's script this so it's gotta be one of the keys in the alphabet and go okay so it's gotta be one of the keys in the alphabet - a few go okay it's got to be one of the special keys on the keyboard and go they don't get points for intuitive key layout but it doesn't work quite well the bad news is I wasn't really able to fix this during our hack session where I have access to a fully working deaf kid so I had to use my personal deaf kit which unfortunately has a broken screen so exporting is the only way to display the video game and it seems like 3d acceleration is broken when you ex forward or maybe there's just a big performance hit in any case you can see it's way more laggy than it was on the dev kit screen itself so bear in mind that there is a pretty big performance hit X forwarding but using exporting I was able to set up the key combinations properly and play Super Mario Brothers 3 pretty cool and I can sort of play this I did test a few other games over X forwarding as you can see here hedge Wars does load up and you can get into the game but it's not particularly playable and it's a similar story for T worlds I also tried liquid war which while it doesn't perform quickly does technically work flawlessly I also wanted to say thank you to Gardner the Linux gamer my subscriber count' was growing at a steady rate and then it wasn't thanks to Gardner who decided to put a link to one of my videos in one of his so here's his channel running on the dev kit over exporting thanks to getting a Gardner I listen to audiobooks constantly so I went to the Libra five dogs took a peek about and it was obvious that gtk was the way to go and I already know Python so I went with Python gtk as the stack loading gtk was not so bad I found a really useful tutorial series by the New Boston link below it walks you through the basics of everything you need to know to program Python gtk apps after learning a bit of gtk and successfully making a clickable interface it looks like this on a dev kit big thanks to David who helped me fix and clean up the interface it does look quite nice now here's where it stands at the moment I haven't created a desktop file so command-line is the only way to launch it at the moment selecting an audiobook looks a lot better on the desktop I'm thinking I might replace this entire file selection dialog with a in window file selection thingy I don't have audio setup with exporting so I'll have to wait for the next hack session to have a fully working def get to test audio output but here's the same app running on my desktop taps you saw and young people he's about a laughter thought better of it it was a few seconds has done at last he said in a stand where among just outside fear flood chapter two the vanishing chapter three the letters pretty cool right as always thank you to my patrons by

=== Open World Hack | OOT ===

zelda ocarina of time is one of the most beloved zelda games of all time hell it's one of the most beloved games of all time but even so it's not an open-world game there have been many hacks put out that have allowed you to break the standard path which has allowed for speedrunning and the like but I was thinking what if I just tried to play this game open world style and said screw y'all I'm gonna play this game the way I want to and go where I want to in the order I want to so that's kind of what I do here using two cheats which give me the ability to go basically anywhere on the map I'm sure you'll understand what the cheats do by the end of this you can find the cheat codes down below of course this is the standard view of this room and I'm pretty sure there's a pot right here it's not accessible by default but I'm just gonna go ahead and fly off the edge here reset this room and I'll show you the magic pot and it's a pretty fancy pot too because it'll give you either a heart or a rupee if you're down the heart it'll be a heart if you're not it'll give you a rupee but there it is in its full glory gonna go ahead and pick it up and here's a great example of the flying mechanic that the cheats provide I have a directional shoot forward as well as a levitate so it basically gives me the ability to go wherever including just to say screw you mr. I jump right on over his face so yeah let's check out the dooku tree inside the great dooku tree oh I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Derek oh shut up no one asked your opinion flying about because I can gotta go get a slingshot why not goddamnit there's no way out of here without a shield I'm gonna try to pop it like an eyeball and that's a red back to our file and I'm feeling like we should go to Goron village which is not that way okey-dokey it's this way then that way and straight gonna float over those wall and place to screw around I'm definitely going in there all right let's clip out of bones it's pretty easy here fortunately sometimes it's pretty bastard they difficult to clip out of bounds but not this time now we're gonna bounce up and down until we get to the right place in the minimap more or less and keep trying till we just get the right angle and hit the loading zone at the door got to be here it's gotta be around here there it is we've made it into this lock to store not much we can do here but it's cool that we're able to get here and I guess that's the point let's go ahead and go to the castle cuz why not it sounds like fun so I'm going to okay so let's go through this village didn't mean to do that but that was pretty cool Oh chicken let's see if that gives us better dexterity in the air comparatively to the NAP program tack somebody actually cared about making the chicken work it's really good I'd say it's just about as good as breath of the wilds glider anyway that's a small distraction back to our goal despite it's night we can just float right on over here pick up the coins fall through the floor ant load the next room okay let's beeline over to the hole we need to crawl through I'm not gonna screw with the milkman we're gonna go directly in beautiful okay let's see what the cards are like oh no garden here at all that's convenient now we can screw around oh boy mmm and we'll go on the back side front side mmm perfect there's our hole whoo there's another guy screw it I'm outta yeah okay that seemed to work for that one too hmm I don't like the angles on this one let's float over it don't lose yourself don't lose yourself oh I saw the shadow get the shadow back in frame there it is and landed beautiful and we're gonna try the same thing again yeah I'm hard off screen I'm screwed rip we're gonna go ahead and do this the right way and sneak behind this guy ever so slowly' dokey and that's our hole all right we made it to the princess's chambers let's check out what's behind all of the walls first if you've got this one it doesn't look very special but hey let's look at it anyway you got ourselves some ugly wallpaper awesome well they can't all be winners let's check out this side now this one's pretty famous you've got your Nintendo characters here rather Mario characters got ourselves the famous frog slash dinosaur depending on who you ask Yoshi Peach Mario Bowser and way over there is Luigi very blurry but hey it's cool that they had a shout-out it's a good franchise well let's check out this other wall this is where canons gonna come through in just a minute kill the gods the invisible guards Oh aunt Isabelle from one side I guess that's kind of interesting well hey princess how you doing Oh telling the water hey it princess oh we can't talk to her we can only attack her that's dumb well I guess we'll talk to her like a normal person I mean it's less cool but what the hell well on that note I think we're gonna go ahead and save quit and call it an episode thank you all for tuning in you

=== Copyleft Smartphone ===

free as in freedom not free beer is a common saying amongst the computer elite it's an idea at the very heart of the computer revolution that is copyleft software a copyleft world looks very different than what has flourished around ios and android even though the core of Android is open the way we make Android handsets is not the manufacturers often have no idea how the drivers that empower their smartphone actually work which is kind of scary this force is supposed to come out with similar specs and just about the same Android based OS it makes you wonder what a world would look like if those proprietary it locked away pieces of code got pushed out and treated like the untrustworthy crapfest that they are after all it's your computer you should be able to study and understand what is happening but you can't because companies are worried that they won't be able to make as much money if you can modify your own device these companies are protecting their IP in a way that makes it illegal to distribute modified copies of their driver so even if you could be compiled a driver and add something interesting you wouldn't be able to share it with a community that's in the same boat as you are with every company defending its own IP to this extreme we the customers suffer it limits what we can do with the devices we already own there's a lot that Android phones can do that Pearson to leave in five cannot do just yet but the Liebherr five is liberated in a way that has never been seen before tourism has picked Hardware that while not easy to use it a phone is much more open than the alternatives for example the leader of five uses an amx which is a grouping of important chips like the GPU and CPU NXP the company responsible for the IMX is dedicated to open-source this means NXP has to spend a lot of time developing drivers they also have to spend a lot of development time getting those drivers into the mainline version of Linux paying for all that dev work is costly it makes NXP chips more expensive compared to other chips with similar specs the result of developing in the open like this is undeniable people passionate about computers can use and improve Pease drivers those same developers would lightly feel encumbered by the numerous proprietary barriers floating around Android I myself cannot stand it even using a hack to hell and back wrong you can only get so much customization out of Android at the end of the day an Android smartphone is hardware running proprietary drivers and an old heavily modified version of Linux plus 80 cool apps and 3 million ad written mostly proprietary useless apps and you've got Android elite from five is hardware running on open drivers at least on the main CPU and is capable of running mainline Linux peers and is dedicated to getting all of its changes pushed into the projects that they are based from where other companies would just for clinics and use their Fork of Linux peers and pushes their changes back into the mainline kernel for everyone to take advantage of instead of demanding new apps be built for the liter 5 Pearson is building tools to adopt the Linux ecosystem of apps which is mostly made up of open source software it's all stuff made and used by the developers or the developers and to benefit the community of users instead of building tooling to help spam users with ads or pop-up chat bubbles P Rossum is enabling you to pick your favorite toolset and go nuts while the end user story is still getting better as absent features are added the developer story is unparalleled already let's take a look at Android the most common programming language is Java the other official language for Android is dump-down Java or Clayton you can read a low-level C or C++ program but you'll still need to use the Android tooling and Android UI elements which means you'll have to write an Android specific app it also means you'll have to write a different app if you want to support anything else other than Android there are other options like unity if you want to drop some cash but at the end of the day you'll be writing the Android way on an Android device let's see what it would take to build a simple application on Android it seems Android studio is just about required to do anything you'll want to pick between Java and kind of Java wonderful it's the simplest example app that could come up with and it's pointlessly opted oriented I don't know about you but I wouldn't be teaching oo P as a hello world example but whatever it's Java you'll also have to deal with some XML that describes the UI cool you got your example code pulled up and it's time to run here you'll need an Android phone to test with or you can follow these directions to set up an emulator finally you can test your app and start writing some real code now let's take a look at the Libra five livre five developers are mostly running in Python rust C and Vala but the leap from five is just Desktop Linux which is arguably one of the best development environments around so really the sky's the limit if you're feeling really zesty write your own programming language package it up and use that there's nothing stopping you print hello world echo hello world display hello world program hello world so many options here it's crazy any good new Linux OS can act as your development playground I write my code in VI and K running on openSUSE which works great for writing apps on the leave and fun better still if you're comfortable with the command line you can install SSH on a labourer v to just develop directly on the phone in a pinch you can even write programs using the touch keyboard Android has a set in stone way of doing things while the Liebherr v gives you suggestions and challenges you to find a better way to implement whatever you're doing the last thing I want to talk about today was the kind of developers these platforms are attracting Android is built in a way that is boring to write code for but any developer that can read a dock can do it since the user base is so big it's profitable to pay for random developers to work on whatever app but you end up with developers that put in the minimum amount of effort which in turn leads to apps that look nice but don't work quite right the labor v is still building its user base but it's the dream device many passionate developers have been waiting for because of its insane flexibility and its policy to copyleft so they private rack people who love writing code while there is still lots left to right I think the end result will be much better than what we see in the Play Store today I love the idea of software written by the community for the community because we want to thanks for watching right you

=== librem5 development kit ===

now that we have a working screen plus a dev kit and the ribbon cable is finally attached properly we can play with the leaver v dev kit properly before we get into this let's talk about the elephant in the room the graphics are not that smooth and this is because the open source GPU driver needs some work looking past the slow GPU drivers we can look at the GUI and how it will be like to use the keyboard is defaulting to a opened position and definitely looks nicer than it did in the early VN build I think a lot of you guys are going to be interested in seeing the web browser so let's pop around that for a bit so I'm loading up YouTube here just because it's super heavy and I want to stress the hell out of this device to see what it might be capable of when it actually releases it definitely is chunking along here scrolling is sluggish let's pick a random video to play wow it's almost smooth it's definitely a video there are definitely some rendering issues where the right side of the display is kind of cut off and not really accessible okay well let's take a look at something else it looks like DuckDuckGo is the default search engine so props on that it's just a simple web page but hey it looks like multi-touch is working and that's pretty cool and we can save things ctrl S on the keyboard alright they have a file selection screen this will be elite reminiscent to how the file browser will eventually look as you can see here the image did save successfully oh I randomly selected a bit of text at least we can check out the copy-paste menu that looks pretty snazzy simple right there barely not all right let's run a speed test on the browser cuz that's an html5 app and html5 apps seem to be working pretty well so run that up of course the right sides cut off but the app is functioning it is testing my speed clicking on an audio file results in a web browser trying to display the audio files contents not quite right and the video files do seem to work so click on a raw video file and it opens up in its own little tab all right well let's download this and try to play it on something else other than the browser cuz it's chunking along and cuts off a little early video downloaded all in all the web browsers not doing so bad the multi-touch support is there so it has a lot of promise and once the GPU driver is sorted out it's gonna be just a little bit of rendering issues that need to be resolved specifically with that right side being chopped the hell off and some random chat window popped up looks like a cool feature though if I could pop up the chat window purposefully with chats in it I would kept running into this now and then definitely a GPU driver thing at this point we SSH in and use systemctl restart Fache to recover the Foss shell and due to the lack of a file browser we can't really attempt to open our saved file just by clicking on it so we're gonna go ahead and open up document viewer ok document reviewers interface is particularly unstable moving on I'm really not sure how to close apps for this app drawer ok we'll have to install em player easy enough because it's you know based on Debian apt-get install and player so playing the video seems to crash the interface but playing with just audio works great next let's take a look at the calendar UI adding a new appointment is pretty simple you just kind of tap it and type in details and you can edit those details repeat reminders how long it's gonna be and again the right side of the screen is cut off we are looking at you Lib handy we'll talk more about that a bit next we pull out the SIM card from my phone shove it in an adapter and shove it in the dev kit I blame the adapter but this was a very tight fit and I actually had to use pliers to pull out the SIM card when we were done testing so we reboot the device with the SIM card in the cellular icon did change to well that and we did try to make a couple calls the result of every call though was either a hung interface a completely crashed Fache or in one case we got a timed out error and some interesting V messages talking about the modem registration state I'll definitely need to pop into the dev forum and see if there's some extra steps that I'm missing to get this hooked up properly to t-mobile at some point we had to reboot and we tried it with the interface just clicking on the power button there it didn't give us any indications that it was rebooting except that it became unresponsive and eventually just did reboot there's a valid way to reboot but I would definitely push for a menu that says are you sure you want to reboot popping in an SD card formatted with ext4 worked just fine LS BLK shows that the SD card was detected and is mountable we didn't test with any Windows formats like fat or NTFS but I don't really need access to those formats I'd rather just use the Linux ext4 format okay everybody loves 2 X 4 word their desktop but now you can export your phone's desktop purism has some pretty simple directions to follow if you want to X forward over ssh your FASTA splay this headless setup works pretty well for me at home and maybe my preferred way to run the GUI but does add some extra lag as it is dumping a lot of the display over the network although I was surprised to see there were fewer graphical glitches running this way my guess is this means live handy is just not quite tuned right at the display resolution of the libra 5 so it might not even be very hard for them to resolve all of these settings issues and where little glitches where the display is cut off too far right so if you want to tweak your settings just set up SSH and X for word year display some of the funny issues we ran into rotation actually worked better in the VM than it did on the actual phone with the keyboard defaulting to an upstate if you just hit the rotation button end up with the keyboard in full screen and no weight to make it novel screen the next funny thing we did was audio recording the result this was a success kind of we couldn't get anything to record shy of outright screaming at the deaf kid so turns out it can record if you scream at it we also saw a weird crash where the keyboard ended up on top and it looked like the application space was on bottom pretty weird crash as you can see fighting against the GPU bugs were the biggest issue the graphical glitches all the time and locked up GPU states that it was causing but if you can look past all of that you can see this is coming along and will be quite an interesting device thank you all for watching bye

=== rm -rf ubuntu... fixable? ===

hello and welcome back everybody I'm kind of screw with Ubuntu for fun not to do anything productive um - or / - stress this command says remove recursively and forcefully everything underneath of the hard drive and away a lot of  in proc and sis is not getting deleted oh wow Wow icons disappeared it's pretty interesting I think our YouTube video struggling still move things so the window manager is at least in memory that's pretty cool oh it's just lost its JPEG still functional well command line returned well that's not found huh huh huh huh ooh boom - how well did you delete yourself let's spin you up in a live disc Wow a surprising amount of  is left I was expecting a empty filesystem maybe even a corrupted file system but there's actually  left now here's the question can you fix this if you can apt-get install by setting a root I think this is probably the right way to do it we're gonna have to download the packages one at a time and the dpkg install them into our really  up don't - I have to get download - okay look at this form it's got the answer okay now we're gonna dpkg install or not root - - root equals /mnt dot slash - whatever the  that area is is that really the file that's complaining about is this file if that's the case maybe work we got to make der - parent I know you can run that touchscreen then maybe we can run the dpkg got us a little bit closer and it wants this directory so mkdir - karent that directory tract in wants this directory - no it wants a file so me sir - parent they had a dpkg again yeah aerozine happened but it tried it means this ain't - clapping - go back up here put it out / - on there okay we got another error this is gonna take a minute I think lube - six star dot Deb it's a smart way to do that I think cuz now we just have to download whatever dependency is missing some reason that one doesn't want to install so here's the files that we have at the moment um I think things are getting a bit screwed up cuz there's not very many of them this is what my root filesystem of my live CD looks like okay you could do this manually but I'm just feeling lazy these are the files that I want this should make all the missing ones plus some let's do a note an LS and hey we have directories now LS in seeing a notice it's empty so it's more whole than it was before hooray put that do PKG command again okay so things are pretty  up and it doesn't want to install anything in that  up mess so we're gonna go ahead and patch a few things by CP - AR /y live PKG gotta copy these files over can I check make sure we got the files copied okay yep they look right cool so maybe the PP kg will still no no damn dammit dammit dammit so yeah dpkg doesn't want to install for us and you know what I'm done with it so we're gonna just copy over we're just gonna copy the route live CD  over the route CD  and see what happens highlight everything and deselect whoops dev sis and prop with control also we don't want to copy our M and T file so we'll deselect that as well copy paste alright so we're going to merge all of the folders as far as replacing files I'm not going to cuz it's a repair right so yeah we're gonna go ahead and skip those okay so I downloaded the the kernel let's try to install it okay another package needs to be downloaded go back to the download download that too how many of them are there going to be - - force damnit CP food fingers and then T good the first things first as I need to do an L o of dev discs by UID find SDA 1 so this is the UUID of SDA one OPI se FS tab hurry look at this syntax cuz I knew you I D good D slash EXT for a co I don't have an esse Cerie just gonna go 1 1 think that should be fine probably maybe let's try that again remake the RAM disk ok theoretically we have a kernel and a ram disk let's reboot actually verify first boot well we've got we even have a grub file we've got ourselves in it our D and we got ourselves kernel let's check out the brother file in here yeah it's not configured at all right the grub files just screwed the hell up I'll just do it manually so when I restart this and we're going to okay so here's our broken grub install Linux boot and there it is let's try it so it half booted we're stuck in the RAM disk meaning it failed to boot fully I think I'm supposed to now our rail route under root so I'm out dev SDA it doesn't have disk drivers really X we've been to your ram disk utensils suck balls if I were to do that on Susa it would include disk drivers I think that's kind of the idea it could include disk trevor's without me having to put a fudge load of options that I don't want to figure out I wonder what if I have Susa help out a little bit here and we'll just use the Susa tools to recover the rest of this because Ubuntu's tools okay so there's half working Lubuntu from the RM is about to turn into something else something else we added openSUSE repositories to our boon to route now we're going to try to install zipper thanks you always trust that repository always trust this repository oh it's a typo okay so here is our repositories some of them work some of them don't this one's broken for sure s - oops G we add that and we'll do a refresh hey hey hey he's downloading our new repository all our posit orys are update in a zipper oh whoops okay now we're installing the base of Seuss on top of the boom - which is a recovery from broken RM dash RF we're gonna go ahead and ignore that that's definitely a conflict from installing a bunch of RPMs on top of a bunch of Deb's this is stupid okay so I'm curious to know what what operating system it thinks it is still thinks it's Ubuntu so that's something but right here zipper wall and apps get on the same system array it still doesn't boot though so yeah zipper let's see if rpm works cuz apt-get doesn't whole thing is all screwed up alright definitely gonna ignore that just install around the Debian system should probably also install grub while we're here grab the Susa version m'kay in it Rd is the Susa command this should make a valid in an RD we hope how it failed I think the ramdisk generated but it didn't zip properly all right we're a link - ask that to the boom - Luke location and we're going to RM the old file ok ok RAM disk please make yourself yeah that did it alright so that was definitely a weird aboon to crossover Susa issue but it made a ram disk we now have boot in it are these  yeah let's reboot actually making big boot grub grub CFG I've got the - OH give that a try ok let's try that why not leave that's not gonna work running shoe hey it booted sort of we're in a round disk so dev SD a hey you have SD devices great slash routes oh boy oh boy some more weird crossover I'm sure Ellen - soft live live 64's where Susa put  and it wants with Mount okay our random disk is missing a library let's reboot so we transferred the host operating system in and RD files over to this computer because it seems to be incapable of generating its own but yeah let's give it a shot why not okay man line the next case boot VM run is - for for its nine it's the one we're gonna have and Rd for for nine boots something might be wrong with my FS tab so okay let's try this syntax instead okay that might be valid okay well if that works great if that doesn't work it doesn't work Wow okay okay so our catastrophe of operating systems doesn't technically boot but Grubbs installed and you can't insure the system so I was thinking at this point I might as well see what the hell it looks like as an actual running system so I'm gonna go ahead and use a recovery method to boot this system essentially I'm gonna boot my key : x and qu Roden and start up the graphical environment to see what the hell it looks like this could be interesting I think I'm supposed to mount our rail route under root so mount dev SDA okay xhose plus beautiful now we can cure NT okay so this is our weirdest operating system we do a cat pet sea star re out star it's been recovered sort of from an RM dash RF sort of there are more files in route than there used to be but here's the weird zipper get yes it does have both commands one is not functional and look at this our desktop environment doesn't fully work but the comp is component and the window manager works so I still think that's a win it's an alt all around wing Akira Firefox probably yep can't even run Firefox okay well thanks for watching I hope you had a good time I had a great time

=== Linux Install Guide ===

so you've heard about Linux and you might want to try installing it here's everything you need to know to get going so the first step is to figure out where you're gonna install I strongly recommend you do not install on your primary production machine either a separate hard drive to install on or an entirely separate machine to install on I do not recommend dual booting for a beginner run on over to DistroWatch see which distribution looks the most appealing to you because at the end of the day they're basically all the same to install this is the workflow pick the OS go to that OSS website download that OSS ISO the ISO is the special installation image the legacy way of using this would be to physically burn it to a DVD and then install from the DVD as you may have noticed though computers don't ship with CD drives anymore so we put ISO images on USBs these days and install from a USB or what we call a live USB to create a live USB there are a few options for those Windows users out there I recommend you use a piece of software called Rufus for the Linux users out there you can use unetbootin dd or a piece of software called Janet and that's not the only options but those are the ones I'm gonna go ahead and cover real quick Rufus it's pretty easy to download once you download it you put your drive in you run it you select your ISO image you hit start select DD mode that's it here's unetbootin make sure USB is shown upon opening it if not you need to put a USB in and close it reopen it select your ISO and hit the Go button it's pretty simple janna is a fancy command line environment that has a bunch of cool built-in commands to help you do Linux tasks one of which is to create a live USB you simply type in the path to the ISO and type in make USB it asks you which devices your thumb drive and it does what it needs to do and of course this is really just a DD command you could literally just run this DD demand on any distro and that'll usually work on Windows after the drive has been made you can pull out the drive and you're good to go on Linux after the drive has been created I always recommend you type in the sync command and you're ready to go we have your ID USB now the next step is to put that USB into the computer and then tell that machine to boot from the USB device to get to the BIOS boot options is a little different on every machine it could be F 6 f 8 f 9 F one escape delete and it really depends on a manufacturer of your machine most computers will tell you which button to press one it boots up if it doesn't try F one try escape try delete and keep your booting until you figure it out once you do find the boot menu scroll down to the name-brand of your USB and hit enter and you should see a grub screen with whatever distribution you chose partitioning is probably the trickiest thing to get your head around but once you get partitioning down and there's not much more to learn before you can install every distribution you want at the lowest level a hard disk is a bunch of ones and zeros in order to make those ones and zeros useful we have to lay down a partition table a partition table simply keep track of all of the partitions on a disk and they do this by using specific locations at the beginning of your disk to reference where the rest of the partitions are and then of course you have partitions they are the thing that holds files there are two primary partition table types you have MBR which is the old one and not really needed if you have a UEFI BIOS and you've got the new one which is called GPT but does require a UEFI BIOS to boot from as most bios's our UEFI at this point I strongly recommend you use GPT GPT allows for more than four primary partitions which means you can turn your physical hard disk into as many drives as you want okay now we have a partition table let's talk about partition types you have fat32 which is going to be the one you use on small thumb drives in Windows but it's also what you use for UEFI boot partitions NTFS is the newer windows file system it is better than faculty - as it can support more than 4 gigabyte files and very large partition sizes the extent is my recommended Linux file system use the newest version in this case extent for btrfs is similar to extent except it it supports snapshotting so you can snapshot your filesystem break it and then revert it back to how it was before XFS is similar to extent and NTFS and of course there's the swap partition type swap is cool what it does is it uses part of your hard disk as a virtualized Ram so if your computer runs out of RAM it starts using your hard disk for RAM but Ram is way faster than your hard disk so it's kind of like slow Ram for a simple Linux install we're going to use three partitions the first partition we need is a fat32 partition with a boot flag it needs to be about a gig the next partition we need can be most of the remaining disk this will be where the OS and your home directory will go and we'll call this one root I recommend ext for this and the last partition we're going to add is this swap partition stick to around 4 gigabytes all right so quick recap we're gonna download an ISO put that ISO on a USB using Rufus or unetbootin or DD then we're gonna put that USB in a machine get to the boot menu in the machine go to the usb go to the Installer partition a UEFI bios partition 8 root filesystem and n partition swap that's the gist alright let's download some dish gross download a new boot ooh downloading mint you downloading pop OS downloading fedora downloading open soos let's install a blue to nice-looking installer it's pretty simple you just hit next a bunch of times well install the third-party software because graphics are great and everyone likes mp3 files for partitioning you could do automatic partitioning for basically any distribution you want especially if you're not afraid of losing any data on the disk but as this is getting to know Linux let's do manual partitioning for everything we're going to create a new partition table add on here our efi partition we're going add a one gigabyte UEFI system partition we're going to add as big as we want root partition for all our files and then we're gonna add some swap with whatever we got left good enough and that's that's it it installs and it stalled cool alright let's install mint so we put the drive an of mint the Installer looks more or less the same as a boon to actually we're going to install third party stuff we're going to do something else for the partitioner and add a new partition table let's add our EFI boot partition if I system partition excuse me let's add our root partition and let's add our swap partition we'll select your time zone enter our username or password and that's it pretty simple install all right let's install pop Linux boot to the thumb drive okay that installer is not based on the Ubuntu one looks very nice kind of reminiscent of Mac OS X we'll go for the advanced installer oh this is a weird partitioner it opens up gparted for us to create the primary partitions i'll just format things because it's already there and Oh weird then you select which partitions do what I actually kind of like this it's different than any of the other ones looks like this is a two-stage installer we have to reboot okay so it asks for things like Wi-Fi and time song and user creation cool installed let's install Fedora there installer lets you go in any direction you want let's do disk partitioning select which disk you want we'll remove things and things back system let's add an EFI boot partition it's at a real partition let's add a swap partition we'll just make all these standard we don't need to use LBM make sure your time and dates right and you hit install it's pretty cool it also has a two-stage installer where we reboot and add our name after the after the actual primary install cool next up is openSUSE boot to the drive select installation accept the User Agreement I go to configure online repositories because I prefer mat a let's go ahead and select mat a partitioning we're going to start with an existing just delete that stuff let's create a UEFI boot partition let's create a root partition and a swap partition okay cool next we select our time zone then the username we can make sure everything looks right or install additional software and hit install all right and that's installed let's go ahead and install VLC and all the different distributions and see how hard it is to get up and running all right you know Boone - if you type in VLC in the menu it'll drop you right off to the Ubuntu store and let you install VLC from there pretty convenient Linux Mint there was no post installation it literally just came with the LC working so that's that's pretty easy top OS let's go to the store in pop OS okay and then type in VLC and install so it's pretty similar to be a boon to install path where you go to their store and install VLC Fedora in fedora they've separated a lot of the non-free software into a separate repository you actually have to add this repository in order to install VLC and let's do Susa post-install in a similar vein to fedora you need to add a multimedia kodak repository as well when you have the multimedia codec you're gonna run into these conflicts all you do is make sure you select vendor change some distributions are focused on advanced configuration and some distributions are focused on ease of use but really it's it's a matter of what you like so give a couple of try and see what sticks install some stuff by get out of here begone

=== Librem 5 | Server apps ===

we think of phones as a way to consume services they pull data from across the world wide web or in some cases your land in the Android and iOS world a web connection and in most cases a proprietary app like YouTube or Netflix is required to enjoy streaming media but what if it was the other way around what if instead of consuming services your phone instead offered app services to your land the idea of a personal cloud is intriguing to me and since the cloud is largely made up of Linux the library of software is big these days it's pretty common to spin up a small cloud instance and set up a service like Plex or own cloud or MB and having a static IP address is definitely a big plus but this idea of having a mobile cloud is something I've never really considered as interesting until now the Libra 5 is running an OS based on Debian which is a very good server OS let's test out running some server-side software on this phone first up jelly fan I like the licensing of jelly fan more than I like MB but I wasn't able to get jelly fin running on the def kit fortunately it was rather trivial to get M be running it was a matter of W getting the dev file and then simply apt installing that file that's it we are now running a server program on a phone without modification let's see Android do that the next step is to connect to the dev kit any device on the same network will be able to reach the MB instance here I'm using the labrum 13 running openSUSE the URL is simply the phone's IP address colon 80 96 cool we can see the MB initial setup dialog we're gonna need some kind of matey to test with so I went ahead and copied seasons 1 through 3 of next-gen to an SD card and just a note this is 100% legally owned I'll go ahead and mount that under /mnt we'll just add the media folder and let it scan away turns out it's Kentucky as we try to play anything to test I downloaded a dot mp4 file after rescanning the library it plays without issue so for whatever reason the mkv files don't seem to play well or possibly it was a bad copy but this is a Debian computer I might as well fix the issue locally one small script in a few hours later all the files are converted locally to mp4 and they play without for fun let's stress test this a little bit here's what it looks like streaming one connection it did have an initial hiccup but I didn't see it hiccup ever again and here's to not much of a difference and here's three streams running from the dev kit there is a bit of delay when you click to a part of the video that you haven't played yet it has no problem with three streams running on the dev kit plus running VLC locally that is completely nutso for people can enjoy this phone at the same time being able to host your own Netflix like interface plus two terabytes of micro SD card support this phone can certainly pack in the entertainment if you want to be able to upload and download files Google Drive style Aurora files is simple to get installed modify source lists not a repo key apt update and apt install Aurora files you'll need to enable a rewire for this to work here you can enter a new super admin password and you should create a new user once logged in as the new user this is a very basic interface to upload and download files from your phone pretty cool I might give ownCloud a try sometime I think it would be pretty cool to have a mobile interface to my own Libre meone email this demonstrates a clear advantage fork and new Linux / Android Linux while both can host content the implementation details looks rather shitty on Android compared to canoe Linux I also played a bit with a mobile hotspot even when I had the death kit plugged in via ethernet I wasn't able to connect to the mobile hotspot but it did show up when I was scanning for Wi-Fi connections I think a hotspot would be epic in conjunction with a mobile server that way you wouldn't need to connect two devices to the same Wi-Fi you could potentially share a Wi-Fi connection and expose your locally running services on that thanks for watching bye

=== AI-Powered Terminal Assistant: Revolutionizing Command Line Interactions ===

welcome Tech enthusiasts David Hamner here and today I want to show you a project that's set to change the way we interact with our command line interfaces say hello to the AI powered terminal assistant this intelligent assistant interprets natural language queries and executes commands making terminal interactions more intuitive and userfriendly let's take this thing for a spin first let's see what's in our current directory notice how we didn't have to type in the ls command the assistant understood the natural language query and executed the appropriate create command next we ask it to display the license file the assistant correctly used the cat command to show us the content now let's create a directory and navigate into it notice how seamlessly the AI was able to understand the natural language queries and understand the context of the previous command you can also ask it to create multiple files at once without the need for complex syntax navigating back to the previous folder and searching for text files is just as easy the assistant translated our queries into the correct CD and find commands but it's not just about file management our AI assistant can also retrieve system information oops looks like we hadit a small snag here it interpreted our query a bit too literally but don't worry that's the beauty of natural language processing we can simply rephrase our Command there we go by asking how big is the dis we got the information we were looking for this shows the flexibility of our AI assistant in handling different phrasings the assistant can even help with simple coding tasks look how easily it creates a python script and executes it when we encounter an error the AI assistant doesn't just give up but instead it provides debugging information and alternative commands That's The Power of AI in action as you can see this AI power terminal assistant makes command line interfaces more accessible and efficient it's perfect for beginners learning the ropes of terminal commands and it can speed up workflows for experienced users too whether you're managing files retrieving system information or even coding this AI assistant's got your back it's not just about executing commands it's about understanding your intent and providing helpful feedback as always this is open source and the links are in the description thanks for watching bye

=== Librem 5 Dev KIt | USB-C Hub ===

this week we're gonna do a short development update on the labrum 5 device me and my development buddies picked up a USBC powered hub now this hub is interesting you plug in the phone charger on one side and the charge goes through the up and also exposes USB ports you get it all hooked together it looks great and we're ready to boot it up we boot it up and it's boot looping yes we see Penguins over and over and over but only through the USBC hub and again crafty guy comes to my rescue turns out we don't want the power brake that came with the dev kit we want a power brake that can provide 4.8 amps at 5 volts now I don't know how many people have looked at all of their power brakes but that's not common and so we're back to needing go shopping again to pick up a power brick that can provide the needed amperage to power the USBC hub as well as the Libra 5 dev kit so that it might not boot loop haha some of you are thinking well why not use the battery as well that did not help we can powered from the battery we can even have the battery in while we power it from the hub that will result in a successful boot and a useless USB C hub for some reason booting this way nothing powers up over the USBC hub no mouse no keyboard very frustrating in addition to the power brick we're gonna need a SIM card adapter as well it looks like to me that my mini Sam micro Sam whatever the hell's in most smartphones now is gonna need one of the adapters to make the SIM card readable anyway thanks for watching bye

=== Navigating the GNU Linux Filesystem ===

like a new linux file system and other unix-like file systems can be thought of as a hierarchy of directories starting at slash which is usually referred to as root for this example files in a directory show up as squares with the height based on the file size i find it helpful to think of a directory as a location or room every directory in our current location shows up as a hallway leading to its own room building this structure we can show off the gnu linux file system in 3d space here at the start or route we have several essential directories and we'll go over them one at a time but before that let's talk about your current working directory when navigating the command line your console will have a location just like i have a location walking around this 3d file system right now my current working directory is slash or root as we move around this virtual file system i'll show you the relevant commands needed to navigate the command line as well to view your current working directory run pwd in modern linux this stands for print current working directory while originally in unix this command was read as present working directory both mean and do the same thing your current working directory is also often shown in your command line prompt now that we know the command line has a working directory location let's go over what lives in root the boot directory contains all the files necessary for your computer to start up in most cases this means a grub config file and some uefi stuff walking down hallways or changing directories is done with the cd command from the shell to use this run cd space a directory name that's in your current directory this will change your location to the specified directory if you're feeling really zesty cd space dot slash the directory name the dot slash in the previous command means from where i am right now remember where you are right now can be viewed with a pwd command when you want to go back a directory or in this case a room the command can be done relatively which means from where i am right now or i can be done absolutely which means relative to root absolute paths are also sometimes called the full name to get back to root with a relative path the command is cd space dot dot slash dot dot slash dot dot slash each dot dot slash means back one directory for my pwd the absolute way to get back to root is always cd space slash if you want to change directory to the boot file with an absolute path the command would be cd space slash boot all absolute paths or full names start with a slash and work their way down from here on out i'll show you the absolute path and the relative paths for each command hopefully that will give you an idea when to use each next up usr or user user is generally the largest directory on a newly installed system it's used to store application programs however all data here should contain unchanging static data situations like booting a live usb can cause usr to be mounted read-only this is where slash var helps out by always being writable among the various sub-directories invar is slash var cache which contains cache data from application programs var lib contains dynamic data libraries and files var log contains various log files var spool contains mail news and printer cues as you can see var complements the programs and user by giving them a place to write data another important directory and root is called bin bin contains all the ready to run programs that are needed to start the system it contains all the basic command line tools needed to repair an os in case it breaks here you'll find the shells like bash and a lot of the shell commands like ls cd tar kill and vi the program stored here can be run by both the root administrative user and by ordinary users aspen is a lot like ben except its contents are administrative tools that are only available for the root administrative user home contains the user's home directory you can expect to see a folder here for every user on the system this folder is where a file browser or command line shell would open for a typical user it contains all the standard desktop documents music type folders you would expect to see as a regular desktop user on the command line the home folder is often shortened to a tilde this means the same thing as slash home username the administrative user on gnu linux is called root not to be confused with slash which is also called root the admin root user's home directory is the only one not in slash home and instead is stored in slash itself this is more or less the same idea as the directory we just went over except this is owned by the admin user a few directories are 100 dynamically generated by the kernel they use a special magic file system created on startup that doesn't actually exist on a hard drive mainly these are dev proc and sys slash dev contains device nodes which gives user space applications access to your device drivers in your os's running kernel or simply put the kernel makes files that represent hardware on the system a good example is how the kernel creates a file called dev sda for the first hard drive on the system if you plug in a second hard drive on the system the kernel will create a file called slash dev sdb there are however several dev entries that don't correspond to hardware devices for example dev null dev random and dev tty don't actually point at physical hardware but are virtual devices proc and systs have a lot of crossover but proc mostly shows you information about running processes while cis allows you to manipulate the running kernel mnt or mount should be empty it's the recommended place for mounting temporary storage devices like usb thumb drives or cd-roms media is the automatic mnt if you plug in a thumb drive while you're running a desktop environment like gnome or kde it would likely get auto mounted under media etc or etsy is where most of the system configuration files are stored the hard drives that get mounted on boot and where they get mounted to is stored in cfs tab the dns servers used by the system is stored in etsyresolv.conf if you install a service like apache web server its configuration files will likely end up in etsy as well lastly let's talk about temp this is a place applications can write data to that's temporary for example an office app might write your document to slash tmp when you make edits then save those edits to a different location when you save the document the data in slash tmp is automatically removed when your system is rebooted thanks for making it to the end of this deep dive on the new linux file system thanks for watching bye

=== Librem 5 | News and OpenSuSE ===

I wanted to briefly talk about the video purism posted last night the video is just one and a half images but the images say a lot first off this seems to be a rendering of what the phone will look like but more importantly the top overlay implies that they have completed at the hardware schematic for the labrum 5 phone plus the video still says shipping q3 which gives them more or less three months to start shipping I personally wouldn't be sad if they delayed but I'm crazy excited for the device so if it does ship soon awesome if not I think people be happy if it ships this year period shifting gears a little bit so looking back at 2017 some of the early articles that got me excited for the dev kit said that it would be able to run a variety of different distributions as everybody knows openSUSE is the shiny green star of linux distros it has the best battery performance and the coolest package manager' okay it's pronounced zipper but I had a customer once call it that back when I did SUSE Linux support at Novell so it's not hard to tell that I prefer openSUSE it's not that I don't like Debian in fact I would say Debian is my second favorite distro PR OS being Debian based is actually a good thing in my eyes that doesn't mean though that I don't want to see openSUSE running on the Libre 5 first off this is a prime example of hacking together this is not a way to start an official port of openSUSE step 1 solder some to your dev board big shout-out to my roommate thank you for doing the soldering for me you only need to solder rx TX and ground next we flash the dev kit with whatever the latest image is but including the options - - dirt and - - skip cleanup this leaves behind the dev kit image file next go to open SUSE website and download the latest arm 64 build of tumbleweed I went with the just enough OS root file system then we mount our dev kit image not the second petition on the Deaf get image CD to our mount point delete all the Debian that we're not gonna need anymore then we can extract our openSUSE tar file directly to Mt next we just flashed that modified dev kit image and we can use Pico comm to attach that serial device we soldered on this is pretty cool we can see the boot-up messages as you can see not all of this start up well it does get stuck on the network but do note my deaf kit has a broken Ethernet port so that could be the issue here it eventually did reach the login screen and I was able to log in after I entered the password it kind of just sat there looking foolish for a second kind of freaked me out the first time I was like oh crap what's not working but it did login eventually and I did get a prompt here's openSUSE tumbleweed running on the Lieberman v def kit it's using the pure OS kernel but it has the root filesystem of Susa one of the things to note was the root file system was read-only which was a simple fix after remounting the root filesystem he asked opens up fine the partitioner opens up and you can look around your disks here's a quick look at the sir manager a lot of stuff is dead but that's to be expected with this kind of hack job back to PR OS I managed to compile and run the powder to a this is a classic falling sand game but with an absolute crapload of options and materials after loading it up it's obvious that the resolution is weird I started with scale 2 just so I can access the menus a little bit better unfortunately a lot of the screen is cut off doing it this way I thought about changing the resolution in the code but that would result in none of the online levels loading before anybody complains that it's slow do you know that this is running over X forwarding via a USB C cable so I don't see Android doing that anytime soon or ever anyway thanks for watching bye

=== Are Linux Phones Ready in 2025? ===

hello and welcome many of you wanted to know what it's like to daily Drive Mobile Linux on a phone so I installed postmarket OS on my pixel 3A here's my experience of what it's like daily driving mobile Linux let's start with the good stuff postmarket OS has some really cool build scripts that lets you build a custom image for your device with your packages pre-installed also with a customized username and password definitely an interesting approach that gives you a tailored image just for you once the image was built the actual process to flash the 3A was pretty straightforward and easy out of the box there were some useful apps as well as a lot of customization ability the interface is actually pretty decent it's clean mostly responsive and feels natural if you're coming from the gome desktop this whole ecosystem is evolving with things like plasma mobile also being available for developers and power users postmarket OS is truly magical offering a full Linux experience in your pocket need to SSH into a server no problem want to build a python or rust application go for it it you get the full flexibility of the Linux ecosystem all in your pocket okay now for the tough part actually using this as a phone with postmarket OS is really rough the phone modem randomly disappears call Quality is incredibly questionable and the battery life is much worse than it was with Android I even had an experience where I was waiting for an important phone call and during the phone call the modem dropped requiring a full reboot to bring it back up this was brutal completely unacceptable cable and ended up being the reason I flashed back to Android now I hate my phone this operating system is completely rubbish I'll never write a program for it but it gets calls really reliably and I only charge it like maybe twice a week another big issue with a pixel 3A running post Marco OS is you have to select between 2G which can receive calls and 4G which can use data but not receive calls so you have the option of using 4G data or being able to receive and send calls so if you're actually trying to use your phone as a phone it can't use mobile data camera quality took a huge hit it went from looking absolutely gorgeous to looking like it was shot in 480p with postmarket OS you can expect about a day of battery life which is usable but without postmarket OS running Android it can last up to a week GPS fun fun ality was also broken on my 3A I couldn't get a fix on my position with gnome Maps or pure Maps so don't get lost with this device the best you can do is pull up a map of your area if you know where you are the app situation on postmarket OS is actually pretty impressive pretty much every app I wanted to install was there in their store one notable exception was God dot here's the bottom line as a telephone it's terrible as a cool Linux device it's amazing if you're if you're in the market for a cool Linux device absolutely give it a look but if you're looking for something that can reliably pick up a call this is not it it was a lot of fun daily driving postmarket OS on my pixel 3A and I plan on testing out other Linux devices in the future if that kind of thing interests you hit like And subscribe thanks for watching bye on the screen let me tell you how it goes I dream of freedom in the palm of my hand but is this Linux phone really ready to stand terminal XX SSH my fingertips finger full Linux power whenever I need it make a sandwi cleaning a face that feels just like home for developers there's magic in this phone Das my social life but our L pH ready in 2025 the modem's disappearing call CR is a mess battery draining fast camera quality alone 640 by 4 that's luxury Linux phone reality check here's what I know choose between your calls or your mobile beta switch to 2G reboot what bother have you tried it off and on again GPS is broken navigation gone cansas multiple devices to get your jobs done pocket full of G just like Batman the community is building Working Day and Night privacy and freedom that's worth the fight but honesty is needed if we want to grow get commit fix bugs create new ones here's the truth about Linux pharms let's go Linux PHS ready in 2025 The moems Disappearing call qualities a mess can you heit me down know face battery training fast camera quity low lenux phone reality check here's what I know for tinker and hackers it's a playground true if privacy your focus this might work for you n hates this one simple trick but for calls and photos navigation too hello hello I think we're breaking up you might want to wait for a version Colonel Panic at the Disco Linux are coming they're just not quite there a glimpse into the future if you really care 777 my patience drop a comment below share what works for you together we'll build something tried and true sh it off the retion coming just you wait and see

=== Librem 5 | Stuff and Whatnot ===

this is what the early version of the launcher slash app drawer looked like it only loaded the primary apps and left all other dot desktop files on display what this meant was if you installed something new the desktop launcher would be missing after flashing the nude FK image this is all changed now the launcher displays all installed desktop files so for the first time we can see what is pre-installed on the dev kit and I must say some of this stuff was not expected the first thing I thought a little odd was there was a few redundant applications we now have to turn elapse Kings Cross which I'm sure will be the default one at launch and what looks to be the default gnome terminal when testing with Kings Cross I noticed something really interesting the top bar turns red when you use sudo or switch to the root user it also has two VIMS surprisingly no Emacs the vim launcher simply opens a terminal with them running I cannot say that's a remarkably intuitive interface for a text editor on your phone Shivam is definitely a step closer but isn't loading at the moment he calls messaging web and contact apps are appearing twice at the very top like before but also down below with all the other app launchers I was also surprised to see known tweaks installed the menu is clearly not using Lib handy and need some heavy work to be usable in the leave room 5 but it's interesting to see it pre-installed no Maps is also pre-installed playing with that on my desktop has surprised me how functional it is it can create old-school turn-by-turn directions using OpenStreetMaps as its data set it is a good bet this will become the navigation app on the Libra 5 however it does not run on the dev kit at the moment barking out this message the calendar app is not perfect lots of dates are cut off however adding an event is very simple making it redundant with just this little menu thing cool chess is also included by default now like the calendar gtk needs a little bit of work here ya can't really control half the board but the AI does seem to work well and is thoroughly kicking my ass man I hope my old chess club buddies don't see this it also looks like a lot of hard work went into the background settings here we can set the primary background and lock screen background as you can see setting the primary background works very well let's test setting a custom desktop background just for fun we pop open a web browser and search for whatever this penguin with the phone looks appropriate long tap to right-click does nothing The View image button gives us a simple web page with only this image loaded from here a long tap acts as expected and right clicks from this menu we can just save the image as whatever we want now that it's saved off somewhere let's head back to the image background settings at the top we can hit select picture and just navigate to where we saved off the image the file selection dialog is missing the select button or it's being rendered off screen double tap does not seem to select the image either fortunately the keyboard saves us hit the enter key and that selects the picture for us I'm not sure if we have a way to get back to an empty desktop and show off that image without closing all of these applications but we'll go ahead and just close them for now and there we go a custom background image on the leap from 5 dev kit it still needs a little bit of work they still need to add a few options like tile background or stretch background or even add black edges to display the entire image it also seems like the lock screen background is not yet implemented showing just a black screen at the moment if you saw my last video you would know that video playback in the web browser is not amazing at the moment if left untouched it can have some smooth playback but it's best just to use em player and download the video directly let's see how hard it is to download a YouTube video all we need to do is navigate to a YouTube video copy the URL with a long tap to right click and then we pop open to a terminal install youtube-dl if you haven't already then type in YouTube do space long tap and paste that URL right back in there so YouTube deal has no problem running and if we type in M player in a file name the playback is quite smooth I'm sure in the future we'll have native gtk applications for searching and downloading YouTube content I also downloaded the HD version of Nicole's talk about the leap from v it's not only a very good talk but it plays back on the labrum v just fine although I should have set the dimensions better in the talk we see our first glimpse of what the PCB of the labrum 5 will look like oh boy I hope it's that green in the final product this guy online took a stab at labeling stuff on the PCB I'm pretty sure both the headphone and the m2 Jack's are correct pretty interesting I installed super tux which after installed it did appear in the menu the game did load just fine and with the W I could reload the in-game menu I was even able to tap around to the application no other normal key does anything though if you press the key that switches between numbers and letters it acts as valid input in this game somehow so I can select things in the menu and hit the number or ABC key and it selects that menu item anyway using this odd input method I was able to try to start a game however on start the app and/or the phone crashed every time I also loaded up mine tests which appeared in the menu but failed to load utterly here's a bit of debug output I did install a few other little games but my camera just died so darn liked this video q3 is almost at an end with it we can expect a phone or delay let me know in the comments below which you'll think it'll be at the end of this month thanks for watching bye

=== MAGI OS | Public Test ===

this is the first working version of Magi OS it takes the desktop environment Magi which integrates a bunch of AI tools and packages it into a Debian ISO it has the NVIDIA drivers preloaded and everything's open source let's take a look with the image freshly DD I'm going to go ahead and plug it in on this computer it's f11 to get to the BIOS but that does depend on the manufacturer simply select the USB as the boot device and try the live system default password is Magi okay and it's loaded for a complete demonstration I recommend you look at the previous video I made goes over all of the features a couple notes voice translation service will take a while to start up as well as this olama interface it's actively copying this AMA model into vram demonstrated of whisper working out of the box keep in mind the first transcription May Fail as it's still loading the whisper model from the USB vram this is a really handy tool and can be used anywhere in the OS when you highlight something you can have it be read to you by pressing this little speaker button the bottom menu works as well tell me about my selection this is mitro replying for us it is context towar noticing which app is highlighted and what is selected as you can see a good chunk of my vram is being used this operating system is open source and you can try it out today provided you have enough Hardware you can find that link for the download in the description below and feedback is welcome thanks for watching bye

=== librem5 Interface overview ===

recently I decided to invest in the purism libram five phone and I'm ridiculously excited for this device I decided to check out the software stock they've created so far instead of using the default gnome shell like originally planned they've they've created this shell called polish which by default is packaged for Debian but I also found packages in the openSUSE repository it looks like they use Jenkins to build nightly builds whatever the latest stuff is so go ahead and download whatever the latest is run this command to convert it to something VirtualBox can read or use KBM or whatever the hell they want you to do VirtualBox is just easy though but do note that VirtualBox has this weird resolution issue where everything is not quite a phone screen size my guess is that is what's causing a lot of these rendering issues starting up it looks like any other grub x86 distribution of course the phone's gonna look different on startup it's gonna have some other bootloader on the actual Lee brim 5 this is the swipe lockscreen and the default pin is one two three four five six seems pretty basic oh hell there's a rotate option switch to normal perfect alright so the top panel is just that basic drop down on the phone I'm assuming it's just gonna take up most of the top there so do note that this is gonna be a much smaller screen so I'm assuming you'll click on one of these things and it'll switch to a whole new display the back button or something like that but since it's this weird resolution that hasn't been tested much it's kind of screwing up the format I'm assuming but you can definitely get the idea of what they've created and added it's very gnome like gnome settings spread out in almost a Android interface way it's cool to see this high contrast is holy but I mean legible large text I'm actually pretty impressed with these usability tools if you have a hard time seeing you can definitely turn these up however the cursor size is not super relative for a phone I'm curious to know what the screen reader does I couldn't get it to function but that could be interesting text-to-speech possibly now I couldn't get the zoom options to work either I don't know if that's a VirtualBox issue or what so we'll just have to wait and see on that but my guess is that you can get like a fisheye lens zoom effect which would be pretty cool especially if you can add like a tap and hold fisheye effect also do note that the Libra my phone is be 5.7 inches which if you look at other 5.7 inch phones that's gonna be pretty pretty hefty so theoretically this could be a godsend to someone who needs a phone with large text high contrast zoom effects screen readers so it's got some really interesting promise here holy actual hell that keyboard is ugly please please PLEASE infest time on theming the keyboard that is definitely the ugliest thing I've seen in a while I really have no idea what all these typing assistant and options do or are for they didn't seem to change much once again I don't think a cursor is gonna really be that important once we get to the actual labrum 5 phone touch interface I don't know about this are we gonna be double tapping to right-click essentially on our phone what are we gonna be doing hover click that could be interesting you know for a phone focused on privacy it's kind of hilarious to see Google at the top of this screen lock interesting locations off by default usage and history on ooh trash files interesting now these sound settings look just like the gnome ones which to be honest is kind of awesome friend okay yeah audio is working Oh these power settings seem way more fitting on a desktop than a phone you're gonna have my phone screen on for five minutes and then turn off please no suspend the phone suspend quote-on-quote I don't think so I hope they had some standby options and like ooh promise of a VPN very good now if only I could change the resolution to an arbitrary number and get it close to the EEPROM five sighs this is an interesting feature theoretically we can make the screen more orange or blue depending on the time of day keyboard shortcuts again this seems more fitting for a desktop class desktop instead a phone that has no physical keyboard how about touch screen settings no okay this will be much more complex in the future I'm sure Thunderbolts interesting and I'm assuming this is all of the apps at the moment I wasn't able to find an app drawer so these are the only ones I was able to find the ones under favorites maybe I'm doing something wrong but it does give us a good test sample anyway let's create a bob arbitrary data great data how about some arbitrary data oh okay the thing is at the top he's my favorite okay well I'm assuming it'll be easy to call this person eventually phone dialer looks like a phone dialer no complaints there huh on I'm not really sure what that's gonna look like here's the calendar looks pretty good event okay that's pretty easy straightforward and I like it okay file browser feels just like the gnome one perfect okay don't open the FS tab with document viewer I don't really know any PDFs are so moving on okay let's take a look at the browser not bad good default I mean it looks solid so far oh I don't know phone and click on any of these let's play this video oh that video hello everyone over the thousands of years our planet has been invaded okay it's smooth enough now that doesn't tell us anything about how good it's gonna perform on the actual phone but looks like a good base looks pretty solid check out the terminal all right we got ourselves nice debian-based distribution terminal is obviously the gnome one and because of that it's a solid terminal okay the root password is one two three four five six just like the pin I'm curious to know if they keep those synced on purpose alright the repository seemed to function so solid terminal yep that's about all I could find in this build I'm sure they'll be more every day thanks for watching

=== How to Recover From a Full Root Filesystem ===

hello and welcome back everybody so we've all had that time where we log into our computers and the root filesystem is freaking full well here's a trick on how you can find which file is using up that data command is D you d you by itself is ugly very ugly D you - s gives you a much cleaner output it gives you a summary of the directory I didn't pass in anything so it gave me a summary of my current working directory only I could also say asterisk and it would give me a summary of all of the file slash directories in my working directory since I have no idea where I'm looking I'm gonna start with root everything underneath root so this by itself is fairly useful but I'm still not even really sure what that's in so I'm gonna put a dash cam here so I'm positive this isn't megabytes okay so here we have megabytes but this is still really ugly output I mean you can probably muddle through this and figure out just based on this this data here that far is pretty big and it shouldn't be but even so I'm gonna pipe this to sort dash n which stands for number so sort on the number and yeah here we can see we have to really large directories one is pretty normal to be this big if I'm honest this one though this is really abnormal var is too big so let's modify our above command and put the bar so D you summarized in megabytes everything underneath bar and then sort that so we have negligible data and far log is full of stuff so modify the command again and here's the culprit thanks for watching bye

=== Upgrading to Opensuse Tumbleweed ===

hello and welcome back everybody so I ran into an issue I need to upgrade my system to openSUSE tumbleweed in order to try out the Weiland stuff and I desperately want to try out the Weiland stuff so upgrading they've made this beautiful duck you can see the link down below we're really just gonna follow this doc procedure goes pretty simply you can download the DVD and do a down server upgrade I strongly recommend you do this offline style it's it's safer it's better it's easier you literally just follow these steps but we're gonna do an online upgrade which is more dangerous and there's more things that can go wrong especially if you're trying to use x11 to record it x11 can crash during this and if x11 is running your upgrade well that sucks but we're gonna risk it I think we'll be okay here's my current repositories it's gonna have me just copy all of these into it back backup directory and add the new ones on top of it you could also modify these but that's a lot more work and I'm just gonna go with its recommended way of doing it okay step 1 make that directory and the Etsy od2 Etsy zip repos Dee old so that's that's just copying all of a repository data into a backup directory if we do an LL on these repos Dee old yeah we see a bunch of hooray successfully backed up also if we do a zipper list repositories no repositories to find but that's not a big problem we're about to define them all let's do this one time make sure that they run properly execute and this one added this one okay so we've run all the ad repository things we're gonna go ahead and do the recommended optional bit here - lets do a zipper list repositories - - you are I on a bigger screen than that we'll compare that to this output four and five being to say bolt yep yep looks good to me OBS has some useful documentation to add pac-man here - see look at this there's my pac-man repository and it sets the priority for me thank you very much so we're gonna add the pac-man one as well notice that it's a priority is lower than the other priorities that means that packages are gonna come from here before anywhere else and that's a good thing it'll make that'll make VLC work right as well as my other multimedia packages it's good to do that alright here's the warning it's telling me that I should not do this on an X 11 screen I should definitely not be recording it I'm going to do it anyway I think it's fine zipper doop let's see how this goes all right there okay so reading us pretty carefully it's trying to install the new version of this package and one of my options is to D install the previous version of the package so I'm gonna go with that option or place it okay that seemed to fix all of package issues it's gonna cost me not that much it's really not gonna cost me that much go for it cute quit yes to continue cute quit yes to continue I didn't read those alright so it looks like it has completed successfully it's telling me a bunch of is loaded Ram it needs to be reloaded so it's time to reboot okay so it didn't quite work my graphics drivers were clearly broken when I rebooted I didn't get a graphical environment I logged into the non-graphical terminal and went into YaST then software management I hit shift tab to go up to filter down arrow to get to this menu arrow up to go to repositories great then select Nvidia then I just marked these for removal a lot of things will complain break things you don't want to uninstall anything else because we're gonna immediately reinstall these again then I had except I uninstall this stuff then you come back in here and you simply reinstall these same ones you hit except it'll reinstall your graphics drivers I rebooted and everything came up really well to prove that here we go here's a cat of my Etsy release file and as you can see we were running temple bead thanks for watching

=== Linux Phones: Fresh Approaches and New Players in 2025 ===

hello everyone after my last deep dive into Linux mobile phones you all shared some amazing feedback let's cover some of the devices I missed and some updates about the devices I covered last time the shift Phone 8 is easily one of the most interesting devices I forgot to mention in my last video they're building a modular device with repairability in mind with over 13 user replaceable modules and Hardware kill switches these guys are taking Hardware repairability to the next level the device runs an Android 14 based operating system but it does promise good ROM support for Linux enthusiasts out there this device is just begging to have different operating systems loaded onto it the Mecha com seems to be taking a completely different approach their Hardware already exists instead of crowdfunding a device that might exist their crowdfunding is more of a way of gauging interest I'm not saying crowdfunding ideas is bad but having a phone shipped quickly after a crowdfund would be a huge benefit people are tired of waiting years for their device I've also started looking into the software stack that Mecca is building their build scripts are written in New Shell their desktop environment ditches gtk entirely and is written in Rust really interesting software stack that's completely different than fos just a quick correction from my last video the flx1 by Fury Labs does apparently have good T-Mobile support in the USA while I can't independently verify this I can say the developers at Fury labs are easy to get a hold of and more than happy to answer your questions as long as you're okay with an Android boot bootstrap approach to get modern Linux up and going this is a fantastic option if I had $550 spare I'd certainly pick up one of these devices to play with for those willing to flash their own devices postmarket OS works really well on the OnePlus 6 OnePlus 6t and Google pixel 3A while these aren't out of the- boox solutions with a little knowhow they make for a great daily driver Yola announced a new community phone pretty exciting for those who are selfish OS fans out of the box it runs selfish 5 with Android app support it's C by an octacore arm processor with 8 gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage this is pretty decently speced for its price if you're in the USA it's always smart to check the LTE bands to make sure that it'll actually work on your cell carrier from the modular design of the shift Phone 8 to Yola's new community device the mobile Linux landscape is really heating up in 2025 thanks for watching bye

=== Linux Distro VS Desktoip Environment ===

so what is the difference between a desktop environment and a Linux distribution a desktop environment is the interface to your Linux distribution for example genome or gnome is a desktop environment KDE similarly is a desktop environment very very very popular gnome and KDE are probably the most popular and have very different workflows KDE you kind of used this start bar at the bottom kind of Windows retro style and have your application at the bottom highly customizable though where as known you have kind of this side panel or sidebar panel and you throw your mouse in the corner every time you want to switch applications so it's a little bit different workflow but it's very effective I'm gonna tase another desktop environment this is my favorite it's also kind of the old style menu launcher it's very customizable one uses the gtk stack which is just what it uses to display its menus and stuff I three is one of the more simple one of the more complex simple environments style and window manager so you use lots of keystrokes and stuff for that one XFC ease really performance light you can put this on a Raspberry Pi or anything that's like low-end and you just want it menu to click on things so as you can tell there's a lot of them cinnamon is based on GT k3 just cool it's kind of like gnome in that case but it's like more retro style II like the matei and Xfce guys and unity is kind of the deprecated one from boom - you can still use it if you're so inclined so great there's sheilas of these but they're not Linux distributions no in fact you can have one distribution install all of these on a single box in fact my box right now has KDE installed matei installed black box installed and I believe xfce installed so I have quite a few to choose from my login manager or a display manager so what exactly is a distribution well it's a bundle of packages including the desktop environment that is shipped together for example the Susa guys they use zipper as their package management they let you choose between KDE and genome in their installer or you if you're an advanced user you can install others as well you'll find that most distributions are shipping with with gnome at this point Linux Mint has their own cinnamon but they also have flavors flavors of their distribution which just come with different pre-installed desktop environments do note that you could install any one of their flavors and install whatever desktop environment you want after the fact if you pay Kubuntu you're gonna end up with a default of gnome or you can install like Caban - or various other flavors and that's actually can't cross the board you can get flavors of any major distribution each distribution is just doing things slightly differently including which desktop environment is default and how that desktop environment comes pre-configured so I hope that clears it up a little bit watching

=== Librem 5 Development Kit [Booting] ===

I'm gonna start with the best footage here is the labrum 5bo dink after we got it to boot we had problem after problem getting user input into the development kit after trying a USB to USB C adapter and even a powered USB hub it doesn't work I hopped on the development forums and it turns out we need a USB C powered hub and at this point without the screen working with touch input a USB C hub is the only way to go unfortunately this means I need to run to the store and grab myself a USB C hub I'm planning to play with the development kit again on Sunday and hopefully with the USB C hub we'll be able to play with the interface on the device as well as test the GSM module for call and text thanks for watching bye

=== initrd ramdisk 101 ===

hello and welcome back I'm gonna show off the in and Ardie what exactly is this thing well it turns out it's a little root filesystem that's loaded before your regular root filesystem it's an intermediate boot stage where your disc drivers and other hardware drivers are loaded once that's complete it mounts your root filesystem over itself and launches your run level system so in order to break this I'm just going to go to my Linux line find this root equals bit and we're going to set it to SDA one in my scenario which is actually my swap space I'm on purpose braking the boot so here we go it's loaded the initial Ram disk and it's not succeeded in mounting root if you see this prompt this type of output your systems broken for the most part and you've got to do recovery fortunately you can chew roots from an environment like this so if I wanted to chew root into my Susa install and regenerate the grub files I would do something like this all right so from here I've got a mostly booted system but with the caveat of my run level system isn't working so even so this is not a properly booted system but it's good enough to pop open yes to go to boot loader and make it regenerate all of those config files now most of the time when you end up in the RAM disk you're gonna take a look at dev and SD whatever won't show up that's probably the most common scenario and that means that your RAM disk is lacking whatever driver is necessary to read your disk in my scenario it was just a grub configuration issue and regenerating the grub file was enough it cannot read your hard drive properly you want to regenerate your in and RD file which can be done by simply reinstalling the kernel or on Susa running m'kay in a tardy both should work and if if you still run into issues at that point you're gonna have to research which module is necessary to include in your in and rd in order for it to boot properly which is usually a bit of research it's not too hard to do but each distribution will have you will include it slightly differently and generate the energy slightly differently so have fun Google about

=== Librem 5 | New Apps ===

some really exciting software is making its way over to the Libra 5 Android apps can now be run but it's still early days I have not found a simple way to duplicate the setup so I don't recommend trying just yet but this is amazing news it means once a pipeline is in place Android apps will be installable on the leave room 5 I'll report back once I can get this set up here working local voice-to-text is now a thing you can do on the Libra 5 big thanks to Mozilla's deep speech and this guy over on github i built a simple UI that wraps around it all and helps you set it up it can be frustrating to download the models cuz they're very large if this gives you any trouble I recommend you just download them on a computer and SCP them over to the phone and you can extract them to this directory with the setup out of the way it's rather simple to use you just hit the start button say something and then hit the stop button this will run the really long Mozilla deep speech command in the background and then report back what the text is do note that it takes about two seconds to process one second of audio with a two to one ratio it's best to talk clearly and quickly it does work pretty well it can definitely be used to spell that tricky word or send a small text message it's not as accurate as Google and it doesn't do swear words but it is usable once translated you can edit the text here or just copied out for you somewhere else Peterson has added a new default app to the preinstalled lineup we now have a dedicated document viewer this will make looking at PDFs a cinch thermals are also much more manageable especially while you're out and about with the screen locked the DRAM now reduces speed and we're seeing temperatures we needed a hack around to achieve before a couple of channel updates to go over I purchased myself a 4k camera and I'm testing out a few new logos let me know what you guys think of the one in this video but do note it's probably going to change here in the near future I apologize for the long break between videos I've been very busy getting up to speed at my new job while I'm definitely gonna miss something inside I'm happy to announce that I took a job working for the morale leaders in technology we're in other words I'm a new technical marketer over at Pier ISM this means peer ISM does pay me but they don't pay for this channel and my dedication to the truth as it stands will not change thanks for watching bye

=== Manjaro in a Chroot ===

for no reason I've decided that I'm going to try to switch to me and djaro in the hardest way that I can imagine I switch I mean not really switch I mean like use Manjaro and my favorite operating system at the same time so I'm gonna build a Chu root of Manjaro try to use its tools learn its ways of doing things and even install like OBS and all the  I need inside of Manjaro and use that we want the smallest one what's the smallest one xfce is fine we're gonna go with the xfce official branch minimal for sure the minimal one oh that's great all right let's take a look at this file and see if we can't find a root filesystem inside of it that's it this is what we got well this looks promising who we have here Oh what do we have here are these it's gotta be this  I'll be is s directory we need to know what the SF s file is q2 that's not how I open it how do I extract one shower light what did that just do Oh  we just got some she again yeah nothing so we're gonna have to do that for all of those squashes I think so see me dubbed opt CD x86 that's the swash command that a squash command worked really well slash which we got we got fruit FS we've got I don't know what that is okay do that too and we'll do the desktop s FS okay so theoretically theoretically we just built the live install environment in the side of downloads temp yeah let's see if we did I guess sudo su temp cat at C star star Oh bitchin well tell you what it didn't not work it seemed to have worked did that make sense no it worked it did work we have a qu root of Manjaro here oh you know what we mean it's right thank you past me for all your help first things first MV temp to man djaro MV Manjaro çb Manjaro okay here are two routes and djaro routes baby shoe routes okay we got a man jar oh that's pretty okay or I and sis and now the scripts not beautiful but it certainly functions slash Manjaro dollar sign I done what Duff just happened yeah Manjaro now has things in it let's cheer it into this now and see what the Frick happens X Oh bus run that as a regular user open terminal goes boss thank you now we just need to choo-choo root su tech ask at Etsy store yeah Skaar good CD there's nobody in home um empty one I think it was a bad idea I meant a full one there it is it's at a launcher oh okay I didn't work at all at this hey that's the one remove remove hey just kind of fun workspace switcher okay terminal okay just make sure we're not like felicitating cat that's the star who needs an installer yeah that's pretty schwifty but I need another like manager or a user what's the live user in Anjar oh um I can't believe we're running Manjaro right here oh  it even has like that rat background a little hybrid operating system what rather I read oh let's make a user David with the user ID of whatever my user ID is and let's mount my home folder inside the Manjaro oh  inside the Manjaro home folder so to do that we just need to look at my password file okay so this is the line for my user fortunately it's ID 1000 more than a hundred I think it's a thousand anyway it should be the default I'm hoping it's gonna be the default on that jar Oh as well yeah Stucky can we just go ahead and pop that I quit s you David okay trying to change directories I think but that's BB David great so I don't know if that's that actually works okay let's go ahead and mount so with mouth -

=== Pinephone Images on the Librem 5 ===

this guy is one of my favorite devs at the moment he has done a lot of the heavy lifting porting the software piercings writing over to my favorite distro this sent me down a path to get opensuse running on the labrum 5. and in the end has created a simple way to run lots of different distributions big thanks to crafty guy and sebastian who helped me work out a lot of the show stopping bugs i didn't start this project to be able to run arch or debian or any other distribution other than sueset so i tried starting out with kiwi which is one of the most powerful distro building tools out there but since setting up an arm 64 environment on opensuse was proving harder than it should be i went with a much more hackerish approach grab the latest pure os image gut it and replace most of its parts with the root file system of some other by hand this process looks a lot cooler but this handy script i slapped together does that job nicely copy your arm 64 file system into this directory copy the latest library 5 image into this directory and run the build script this copies the library 5 image mounts it backs up the fstab and kernel modules deletes everything else then copies the root file system from the other distro runs a small bug fix and then unmounts everything in the end this is a simple way to mess around with any distro that builds for arm on the libra 5. mobian runs fairly well the root file system is out of storage which is causing a bug with a display brightness continually darkening without disk space we cannot edit any user settings the fix for this is running resize 2fs on the root file system with that done we can now edit the user settings and reboot the device safely it comes with a few games 2048 which works perfectly and you can also play a bit of chess files seems to work very well but the text is a bit hard to read at this scale firefox comes pre-configured to work out of the box on wayland this does a good job while browsing on this image you can connect to 4g but it seems like that might have some routing issues preventing it from actually working right don't push the power button if you do the whole screen locks up and you have to reboot text messages work and you can make phone calls but the speaker and microphone don't work so you can't say much past the default lineup seems to work for the most part all in all not a bad image on the library 5. arch linux boots i don't really know if this version came with a gui or if that part's broken i might play with this a bit on the dev kit to see if i can get some console access nemo also boots it leaves you with this nice looking screen but it is rather broken at the moment opensuse takes a minute or two to boot but the os works well wi-fi is broken but booting this on the dev kit gives you access to an rj45 port which works out of the box just like mobian we have a lot of user settings to mess around with the 4g connection dialog was not what i was expecting and it didn't seem to work the terminal font is a bit ugly and the home directory is a bit bare pressing the power button doesn't seem to do anything i can't wait for this to follow in the footsteps of pure os plasma mobile memo ubuntu touch and fedora all ended up at this screen a workaround for this could likely be found with a bit of effort the fact that any of this works at all is a testament to how robust and interchangeable the software and hardware purism is building i'm happy with opensuse starting to work if you fill up to porting to the library 5 i encourage you to take a look at this project and chat with people on the matrix channel thanks for watching bye

=== Librem5 VS Sailfish OS ===

selfish OS is the best mobile Linux operating system to date let's compare it to the Libra 5 development kit of course the Libra 5 has yet to ship so this comparison is a little bit unfair and of course I'll post updates once they become relevant let's talk about hardware the most spec - plus this device has 6 gigabytes of RAM and an octa-core 2.2 gigahertz cortex a53 processor compared to the leap from 5 dev kit which has 3 gigabytes of RAM and a quad-core 1.5 gigahertz cortex a53 processor and of course Pierrot s is a Debian based system and sailfish OS is an RPM based distribution when using lip zip under the hood to install packages and one using dpkg under the hood as far as battery capacity these two devices are more or less equal so it'll be really interesting to compare battery life once the actual libre mon releases now that we have the specs out of the way let's compare boot time there it is with literally half the specs the Libre five dev kits still booted a few seconds faster of course these are Linux devices we're going to want to see what the terminal is like to use peer ISM has recently switched to Kings Cross for the terminal application and selfish OS has been using finger term for quite a while the biggest difference is the keyboard finger term has a built-in keyboard that's unique to just finger term it doesn't appear anywhere else on the device and has lots of very useful terminal input on the other hand Kings Cross uses a standard application keyboard I'm hoping that peer ISM will do something like sailfish OS here and include a dedicated keyboard just for the terminal or perhaps a way to switch between different keyboard layouts one useful for desktop commands and control and all that jazz and one useful for applications I want to type a text message to my mom type thing here's a close-up of the application keyboard these things are identical one of the new added features of this keyboard is the ability to enter a slash this enables you to use regular IRC and a terminal let's go ahead and compare the browsers on simple pages scrolling seems to work fine on both browsers Wikipedia no issue at all I guess there is this weird bug in the Li from five browser where if you're over some elements you can't flick around to scroll quite as well let's take a look at some images that seem to have loaded just a tad bit faster on the dev kit but we can start singing the scrolling joke a bit it seems like the Libra 5 is really fast at the initial rendering of the page but if there's too much content on the actual page scrolling can get choppy video playback isn't exactly smooth on the labrum five but it does seem to work just fine on the selfish OS device also fullscreen seems to not function as well closing the web browser possible on the labrum five so we can take a look at how to do that on each of them the dialer app they are nearly identical they have three basic categories a dialer category history / recent category and a people / contacts category let's take a look at what the labrum v has to uniquely offer the phone will offer three hardware kill switches and a lockdown mode one of the switches will control the camera and microphone one for the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and one for the cellular baseband if you activate all three switches it puts the phone in a lockdown mode this disables not only the camera microphone Wi-Fi Bluetooth cellular baseband but also disables the GPS accelerometer ambient light and proximity sensors it's also important to note this is done on a hardware level power is literally cut from these devices this leaves you with a still working phone well portable Linux dinging with a screen that can talk to anything the Libra 5 can also natively run X 11 and Wayland while selfish OS relies on a compatibility layer called Hybris Hybris loads Android libraries and overrides some symbols from Bionic with G live sea calls making it possible for Bionic based software such as Android only binary blobs to be loaded on G live sea based Linux distributions in addition to that Hybris can also translate android egl calls into Wayland eg o calls allowing Android graphic drivers those stupid blobs to be loaded on Wayland based systems that's where sailfish OS steps in it uses this Wayland based system to display all of its graphics this Hybris stack has been the most popular mobile linux platform for a long time now and I'm very happy to see it go so without the need to use Hybris we can ditch a lot of the complex crappy stack that sailfish OS is forced to use along with so many other mobile Linux distributions this is a massive shift in how mobile Linux is handled allowing for much easier porting of OSS a potentially interesting upcoming feature of the labrum 5 is this so-called no carrier phone of course the labrum 5 like any phone will be able to use a SIM card and make normal calls and text messages however this is likely not the only way you can make calls on the labrum 5 combined with libra mile a future part of the labrum 1 bundle the basic idea is you transfer your phone number to leave room dial the service will provide calling an SMS over a network connection this can take a couple of forms a Wi-Fi only phone or a Wi-Fi + cellular data phone of course to use cellular data you're gonna go need to pick up a data only phone plan from t-mobile or AT&amp;T which is actually fairly cheap like 20 bucks a month at 8 bucks on top of that for the libra one service and you're good to go you can make calls anywhere that you can receive a data connection plus 28 bucks a month is not bad for a phone bill I should also mention purism is very good at up streaming what I mean by this is the work that peer ISM does is less work for everyone else wanting to build a Linux phone the peers own price tag represents a shift in the Linux phone community if the price is too high great weight and pick up a pine phone after the community has finished developing a lot of packages around mobile Linux or you can go ahead and buy a labrum 5 and support the mobile Linux software stack and be one of the first on this new kind of phone as a side note frozen bubble almost works on the dev kit a few small changes to the UI and it would work great touchscreen input isn't working and if you wanted to control with the keyboard the arrow keys are missing while the physics engine seems to work flawlessly the game is technically unplayable due to the lack of input kind of a cool distraction I was also able to test my audiobook player on the Libra 5 dev kit and of course it's working great playing things fast or slow hooray so there's $700 worth it should you buy a Libra 5 well I think that comes down to how much you want to see mobile Linux succeed if the Leiberman 5 is a success than the pine phone and many other Linux devices will likely also succeed thanks for watching bye

=== Librem 5 | Calling and Updates ===

the first Libra five prototypes have started shipping if you're just dying to have an early badge phone take a deep breath and relax they're pretty rare for one and the software is now just becoming usable evergreen or q2 2020 is when they'll be available in mass stick around to the end of the video to find out how you can get a freely broom 5 that's right I'm doing a giveaway thing it's still early days for the lead from five it looks like the camera video output and call routing will need more development before it's fully working and integrated into the OS but I don't see how this is any different than when they shipped the dev kits with non-functional screens that turned out just fine plus the labrum file has a much better upgrade mechanic than Android once peer ISM fixes something they can push the fix directly to a repo and you can upgrade just the needed components whereas Android would have to do a full system upgrade to change anything core I don't think calling will take long to fix and I bet it has something to do with this bug but I'm only guessing that the two are related if they are then perhaps they've disabled the audio until they can correct for some Distortion okay so calls is a work in progress but what about a software solution after installing mumble and Qt Weyland five which might be useful to include by default the mumble you I started up it could definitely use a bit of optimization though but I was able to successfully connect to a surfer unfortunately the audio quality was oops you'll want to make sure that hardware switch is enabled what yes I can hear you can you hear me I'm recording this conversation just so you know officer and it is working and we have voice chat over tcp/ip actually it may be UDP IP but we have voice chat over a mumble not telephony right now so at the very least you'll be able to chat with anyone you can convince to connect to a mumble server when it came time to flash the deaf kit we found the old version of you you you no longer worked this force us to recompile a new version of uuu if you're on Debian you might be able to get away with just upgrading that uuu package post reflash it's nice to see that the usage app is included by default I quite like the way that it visualizes which directories are eating up all your data connecting to Wi-Fi works without issue as long as that hardware switch is enabled and it eliminates the need for me to have to run on Ethernet court so that's quite convenient taking a look at the browser it seems usable you can get around and find whatever you might want to look up for example this is a Libre five hack session from Wade's point of view I really do appreciate his work and he's been hosting the Libre five hack sessions which is where I've been getting most of my footage and takes place every two weeks so big shout out and thanks to Wade on the heavier pages you might be better off with a dedicated gtk application but possibly more development time will make this smooth in the browser I also gave Firefox ago it installed just fine and scrolling works if you can manage to hit that tiny scrollbar a simple config tweak in Firefox would allow for touch scrolling but unfortunately the input doesn't map correctly so the keyboard is just like inputting random crap up until now the power or lock button didn't do much unless you held it down but now it locks the screen unlocking the screen seems to struggle I messed around with this for a bit just because it was entertaining I was kind of hoping that if I locked and unlocked it enough times that the screen would eventually realign up but this does not seem to be the case a reboot or restarting Fache was needed in order to correct the issue talk about a colorful bug it'd be interesting to know if this affects a Libra 5 phone as well as the dev kit the keyboard has more options you can add other languages in the settings and then switch between them in the keyboard I think a USA Terminal layout would be nice something with tab and control initially the store page did not populate but once I ran apt-get update in a terminal it did populate just fine I also ran into a weird bug where if you've told it to install an app and then you hit cancel it assumes that the package is installed but cannot uninstall or reinstalled package but if it does get in this weird state you can just app to install whatever in a terminal as for app development I did see an interesting behavior in Fache if your window size becomes too big parts of the screen will get cut off but once the screen can be resized back down it does on the desktop if it becomes too big the app will stay big until manually resized I just thought this was some cool self-correcting behavior so when shipping batches got announced impatience got the better of me and I bought a second labrum five from handle turns out both of the devices will be in evergreen so I'm giving one away to this fine community to enter the labor 5 giveaway leave a comment below of how you would use the labrum 5 if you had one then I'll assign a number of entries based on how cool the idea is as long as you plan to use the labrum 5 you'll get at least one entry in the giveaway in the end I'll use some sort of random program to pull a winner come Q to 2020 I expect the device will fill a lot smoother and finally be ready to take its place as a primary device thanks for watching bye

=== Librem 5 Dogwood Game Emulation ===

the quad-core CPU and powerful GPU can play SNES games easily after tweaking the graphics settings and sound settings to not use vsync snes9x seems to use G TK 3 which is natively displayed in Weiland this is cool because you can use the on-screen keyboard to interact with the game in this demo I'll be using this Bluetooth keyboard this Auto connects quite quickly after the first pairing Super Mario World plays very well I'll test attaching a controller at some point this would also be a good opportunity for someone to make an onscreen controller for squeak board directions to get started could be found on this blog and 64 emulation works very well on the leapin 5 a few frames are dropped now and then but for the most part it plays at full speed for some reason the pause menu is rather slow but it does eventually pop up a few times while is messing around with other applications the graphics ended up becoming corrupt quite simple to fix just restart the app a bug with a default keyboard makes it so that the keys mismatch in ex Wayland windows while that bug is being worked on you can simply swap out virtual keyboards or use a Bluetooth keyboard like I am here overall I'm really impressed with what this computer shaped phone can do as time goes on this kind of thing will become simple to set up and enjoy thanks for watching bye

=== Alternative Librem GUI | KDE Plasma Mobile ===

the official interface for the Liam five phone will be Fache however purism has sent several devices out to the KDE community to help get KDE plasma mobile working shout out to crafty guy who is doing a lot of the work towards plasma mobile on the labrum 5 phone he has compiled it and even tested it on the device there are several things that are not working under Weiland at this point so not only is it in pre-alpha on the device but the VM I'll be testing is also in pre-alpha and very crashy I had to reboot the VM several times in order to get this footage but let's go ahead and take a look we're gonna ahead and try without installing it doesn't seem like they have Calamari's working yet so you can't install this image but you can certainly test it out it's clearly based on Ubuntu 1604 and let's look at the interface so a lot of these panels are not working if I click anywhere on the top panel everything crashes there's phone app and install our app that's not implemented camera and an app store these squares will let you switch between already open apps that crashes often and the exit button exits whatever is open well I do like that when you open an application it lights up the exit button letting you know that there is an application ready to be closed this doesn't seem to be loading that well let's go ahead and retry that okay and we crashed the panel but the phone popped up so hey that's cool umm quick overview what the phone screens gonna look like here's the Rana pop-up of broken connections dialog well with the blacked out menus I can't exit this application or really do anything so I'm gonna have to reboot okay now that we're rebooted let's go ahead and try the discover store it definitely has a lot of packages in it so I'm assuming this has got a lot of what is in the aboon to 16.04 store I'm not sure if all of these have been modified specifically to work on a phone but they are at least easily installable problem is I have no idea what the root password is so the settings looks quite nice much simpler than that in Fache and I like some of the defaults a bit more alright so developer mode that's pretty cool writable filesystem I wish Android had a button like that and allow remote SSH isn't letting me click it but I'm assuming will eventually work and is also a great feature and here's random wireless pop-up and here's where we can just screen brightness lock screen sleep turn off screen I do like that these features are off by default but do allow you to turn them on and Fache it felt more like they were just kind of already on by default now can't give them too much because no device is actually shipped with either of these two interfaces working this I have to give them credit for and is probably much better than it will ever be in Fache the theming it looks like they have good QT theming working so you can change this up I'm assuming and you'll also be able to download additional themes online once this has a community behind it time and date does seem kind of barebone but we'll give it some time to grow V player I wonder what V player is well got ourselves this nice little blue thing up okay so home directory I can't seem to find any videos to play in here so just imagine that this can play videos let's go up up up up that's past route or above route okay well good game I don't think I can close this so yep that's a quick overview of KDE plasma mobile it is not super stable but it is getting there and it is a good alternative to the Fache shell we reviewed a couple weeks back I'll be playing with the development kits more this week and we'll be releasing another purism video hopefully on Tuesday

if you run a terminal command the output has to go somewhere right for example LS is how you look around on a terminal the output is printed to your terminal screen so in this case standard out is printed to our terminal window right here now we can also make an error message come up by doing slash not here and that's not a directory that exists so it gives me this error message now this error message is actually printed to standard error which in this case is also the terminal window but they are actually separate pipes you can separate them I'll only show you we have printed the screen a standard message and print it to the screen a standard error message let's go ahead and manipulate them a little so LS now greater than this is redirect character is how we put stuff into a file so LS redirect to a arbitrary file let's do a file in this directory called out dot txt and you'll notice there's no output cuz the program LS instead of printing its standard output to the screen it printed its standard output to this file I'm gonna cat that file which just prints out its content it just says whatever LS said let's go back to our not here example if we redirect that to the same file you'll see it still prints the error message because we only redirected standard out to the file not standard error and all the messages were to standard error so if we want to redirect both you put and in front of the greater-than sign and that says redirect both standard air and standard out okay so if you just want to redirect standard air we can replace that with it too and since everything is an error everything still went to out text yeah that's kind of the main ways to print to a file but what if we want to make the output of one program the input of another that's done with a pipe so let's do something about it like LS dot slash just LS is simpler whatever LS and then we're going to pipe that into another program let's do prep and since grep is a searching tool let's search for something and we have how about RPM so we run LS which prints this stuff to standard out but that stops redirected into grab which searches for RPM in this case and we get a nice filtered output of these files so that's one of the use cases for redirecting to a program you could also redirect it to let's say cut let's say all of these have a period who is ready we can do grep for any period so anything that has an extension okay how to put a backslash in front of that because it was doing regular expressions and in regular expressions dots one dot means match any character so here is LS filtered down to all of things that have a dot or an extension now we can pipe that stuff over to cut tell it to cut on if it's gonna do the same thing but let's try the delimiter of period and we want the field to so the last part okay cool so this runs at last which gives us all of the files we pipe that to graph which searches for anything that has an extension then we pipe that to cut which cuts off that extension there are a couple product files and a couple text files in this directory about it thanks for watching bye

=== Whisper Large V3 Turbo | Tested ===

hello and welcome today we're taking a look at whisper large version 3 Turbo it's open source and you can run it locally let's take a look this is the server script it lets me use other client scripts to connect and use the whisper model pretty easily here's my client code it lets me use this handy little device to push a button uh it's just a Ada fruit feather and when I push the button it it uh Records that I've done that this is a test okay okay so you can see it's already pretty fast and it's uh pretty handy I'm going to go ahead and demo what it's like to use whisper 3 Turbo large uh it's a very powerful opsource local voice translation system as you can see it's incredibly powerful and lets me translate my voice in a live manner every time I end a sentence I simply just let go of this button it makes it really easy for me to get a perfect voice translation you can use ASR to do this sort of uh voice clipping automatically but it's a little bit more buggy than if I hold a button all in all this is crazy impressive and one of the best most accurate and speediest voice translation systems on the market and it's fully open source check that out it's only using 12% of my vram all in all I'm crazy impressed and I'm sure you could build this out into a really impressive AI system by attaching a large language model on the back end anyway thanks for watching bye

=== Recover Forgotten Password ===

it's happened again I forgot my root password and my user password here's a quick tutorial on how you can do some password recovery on Linux we're gonna reboot the machine and spam the down arrow cuz right after the BIOS loads you'll load grub and if you're not spamming down it'll just go right on by okey dokey so here it is scroll back up to a boon to press e to edit scroll all the way down to the init RD line okay now press the left arrow and we should be on Linux line very end space and rewrite our W space in it equals slash bin slash bash okie dokie so what this does is it mounts the root filesystem rewrite and it bypasses the init system and just runs bash awesome f10 boots this from here it's pretty simple pass WD will change your root password pass WD space a user name will change the user names password that's it you did it you change the root password now from here you're gonna have to probably take some special needs to reboot the machine I mean hard reset probably yep you

=== Librem 5 Birch | Status ===

look what peer ISM just sent me in the mail it's a birch version of the leap from five this is a rather small batch and it's the first batch that was shipped customers first things first audio if you're an owner of the Libre five you'll notice that the phone is rather silent if you fiddle around with the gnome settings it still won't help this is because the volume controls aren't linked to any hardware mixers yet to get audio output working in general you'll need to install and use also a mixer so hop on the phone via SSH and install also util then run also mixer and you can adjust the sound level freely but alarms do go off as long as the device is powered on and audio is enabled the date time was messed up when I first got the device but after adding a SIM card the clock self corrected and picked the right time zone all right so the biggest issue with the Libre five is definitely the power in my experience the Libre five can't hold or maintain a charge while powered on and plugged in however this will not charge the device at least not within a few weeks powered off this is not an issue although it will get warm to the touch just charging with a Libre five fully charged and also connected to a charger it ended up pulling about 205 milliamp hours in just a half hour which is the total capacity of the phone so now if you're okay with a bit less Pepe Ness you can force the CPU to stay at 1 gigahertz ed of boosting to 1.5 when the phone is busy doing things it won't help standby time as in standby oh it never boosts to 1.5 anyway but it should increase the duration that you can actively use the device although more testing is needed to know for sure while working with a device over SSH I found this command rather helpful to check on the battery status here's what the phone looks like while idling the keyboard feels like a proper smartphone keyboard although I did see it repeat keys when I forced the CPU to stay at 1 gigahertz EPU is allowed to boost to 1.5 this does not seem to be an issue I do miss having input predictions though one feature I've seen added and removed from Android countless times is the ability to search through your own applications which is now working just fine on the Liebherr 5 big thanks to Nicole and Pierre ISM for getting me a working deaf kid the extra time they took to solder on the serial connections was a nice touch on the Libre 5 birch you can receive calls and even hear what the other person is saying but they cannot hear you I was also able to make a phone call using the dev kit but the audio quality was very poor sadly I didn't get a recording of it as far as reception it's better than what I'm already getting with my sailfish OS device with my Sony I have to step outside my apartment to receive calls or texts although I've only tested the device where I live and where I work I'm sure results will vary depending on what bans are available where you are arguably one of the most important features is texting which works for the most part when you go to text somebody new the known contacts app never opens if you open them contacts manually and add someone it will show up as an option to text but selecting them won't work but if somebody else texts you it's trivial to reply to them it works as expected another issue is there's no audio played when you receive a text overall the device is a joy to use it's becoming more and more dependable I mean just look at this uptime they definitely like to keep their kernels up to date as well just for fun I messed around and installed a couple file browsers but none of them really seemed usable so if you want to look at what files you have the best way is command line fortunately tinkering with apps is simple you can cleanly install whatever you want and simply remove it if it doesn't work messing around in this manner I found a few games already that it worked really well lights-off is working just fine and this one has multi-touch input working pretty cool the built-in browser works just fine for basic tasks if you need to search for command or research and air this browser will do just fine if you want to consume videos this is not the browser you're looking for at least not yet inevitably an app will eventually Hank and when they do you can pop open the usage app and simply kill whatever is broken this will even let you kill Fache itself although doing so is not recommended one of the bigger issues is the power button it will lock the screen once the libre v is powered on but in order to turn on the labor v you have to pop in and out the battery a software solution should be coming down the road i also saw a few less critical bugs the first tab after you unlock a screen brings up the top menu thing if you disconnect and reconnect from Wi-Fi sometimes internet takes a while to come back up also the reboot acts like a shutdown the only thing keeping me from using this is my daily driver is the poor battery performance I'm sure the bigger battery coming in just not will help but software improvements will also be needed in order to get this phone through a day thanks for watching bye you

=== Robocalls | Fight Bots with Bots ===

hello this is janna from first show legit your credit score has skipped to a dangerous level robocalls have been an issue for a long time now with new user-empowered linux phones on the market i thought it was time that we had a set of tools to fight against all these scams google voice lowers the number of robotic calls by asking for the name of the person calling then providing that name when the call comes in this is a good system but it still requires user input on both sides of the call a better system would simply ask the unknown caller for input to prove that they're human with that as my goal i set out to create an interactive voice response system for the libra 5. the core of this had a few parts the first part was finding a way to read dtmf tones fortunately this is something i solved a long time ago you can dump a bunch of audio data to standard out then pipe that data to socks to change the audio format a bit if this is not a live audio stream pv can be used to control just how fast standard out is and finally we can pipe that into multimod ng cool so we can read dtmf codes out of a the next step is to figure out how to pull live audio data from a phone call ba control and pa command are quite helpful in finding a list of pulse audio syncs from there it's just a matter of getting the right command line options this raw audio data comes from the phone call it's not the right rate to be read by multimod ng so it needs to be converted a bit with socks this data is just what multimod ng needs to read our dtmf codes just like that we can see the keys the caller has entered while in a phone call playing audio to a phone call is not difficult pa play is the simplest way next up on the to-do list is automation for the moment i'm using this really hacky way to auto answer a phone call this is watching the modem directly and sending it a command to connect at the right time it then also runs a script called ivr.pi in the script i've exposed a few helpful functions that can be used say we'll use espeak to send audio to an active phone call by default it will repeat every 4 seconds but that's easy to override dtmf will listen for a given number of dmf codes it will return a list once the right number of keys have been entered record call dumps audio into the calls and waits for the user to enter a pound i still need to implement ring phone but the idea is it'll allow the phone to ring like normal this is where the project is today welcome to my phone press one if you're human press do to leave a message welcome to my phone press one if you're human press two to leave a message press hash when you are done i'm planning to keep this running on my phone once ring phone is implemented and once i solve the issue where the feedback system gets grumpy with multiple calls answered behind modem manager's back the potential here is nuts you could easily plop together a script that asks for a password or blocks a certain number you can set up a script that with the right pin texts your gps location or sets off an alarm anyway feel free to contribute over on bitbucket thanks for watching bye mode

=== Let's install,  OpenSuSE on the GPD WIN ===

how to install and configure openSUSE for the GPD win or rather the GPD then maybe not anyway you need a pretty large USB Drive recommend at least eight gigabytes x86 alright just have to let this download let's open the image writer so I'm gonna install my thumb drive in my main computer it was automatically detected my 8 gigabyte thumb drive and we've selected the latest snapshot go ahead and write that it will destroy any data on the thumb drive it just will post word now we just wait for this magic box to complete now's a good time to shout out to the guy who did actually most of the work and did like all the kernel coding and whatnot this guy's a badass just saying I've compiled his kernel and I'll link to where you can download the RPM it is ideal if you downgrade your bios in Windows before you do this if you didn't you'll still be ok but it is ideal if you do because there's a couple BIOS changes that we can change if we have an older BIOS and it's actually pretty easy to install this older BIOS I'll link to the zip folder all you do is in Windows extract the zip folder double-click the batch file and it just installs the BIOS and it's pretty easy I have heard there's a way to install a BIOS in Linux I've never done that and I will never do that because I'm already on the write BIOS so good luck with that our image is done writing go ahead and pull out my thumb drive and insert it into the back of my GPU with all right let's spam delete oh boy notice their BIOS is like weirdly sideways it's okay it's not too hard to use if you don't have this many options you have the wrong BIOS or rather the less ideal BIOS but if you install this kernel you'll still be okay I've changed my boot option to the UEFI USB disk so theoretically that's gonna allow me to go to the USB device now save and exit save changing settings so let's boot it up expecting it to use the USB device great it detected it I hit down arrow really quick there so that it wouldn't continue booting into the Installer I'm gonna hit eetu edit this and scroll down to my Linux line at the end of my Linux line I'm going to append this argument and this argument with a space in between so I'll do that now once that's typed in I'm gonna hold down the thing key and 0 which will be f10 and that'll boot me into my system if you have a USB hub and could be booting from a USB hub and you can put a USB mouse in or if you could plug into a HDMI monitor you're way better off then I'm about to be because I'm gonna have to use a joystick that's that up is not up and it's rotated 90 degrees because the contest of how well can you install using a 90 degree rotated Mouse I'm just gonna go to next all the way to the partitioner screen I feel adventurous so I'm gonna go to expert partitioner you can partition it however you want but so I went with a really simple partition scheme here I have a half gig fat32 partition very beginning for my EFI boot then I have a 4 gigabyte swap partition and then I have the rest allocated for my Roo partition make sure that you have boo-ki fi set for your mount point for the fat32 filesystem the rest of this is going to be pretty standard I'm gonna install with gnome but I'm gonna install mattei after I'm done I just prefer matei at the end of the day and now we just wait for it to install let's get another thumb drive or you can repartition your old thumb drive we're done with it now and copy over the wireless config file alright so we've got the file copied over to our thumb drive go ahead and eject this I'm going to open a terminal CD to my drive so CP your local copy slash firmware BR CM permission denied yeah okay sudo once that file has been copied over go ahead and reboot and you should have wireless connectivity so if you're still having wireless issues it could be because of this BIOS bug it can be worked around if you have this older version of the BIOS just by going to this chipset Southbridge etc etc and setting it to disabled I recommend that you do this if you have the ability to alright so this is just iceweasel I'm just gonna use this temporarily to install Mattei so then I'm just gonna go to software management go to view patterns and mattei and then accept and wait for your matei packages to install and i have an Matei option now all right so now we have Mattei installed a couple things are messed up one the screen is sideways but we can use the touchscreen while it's sideways that will cause a bug once we rotate the display so I'll go ahead and rotate this plane now just by going to the menu typing a display just blue settings right all right so now the things are rotated right I'll keep this configuration Oh touchscreen is no longer working all right another thing that drives me crazy is the mouse I feel like setting this to left-handed Mouse makes more sense that way you can control your computer with this most of the times if I want to go to folders I can etc etc rather than having to use two hands to control the device always I have a fancy script I'll put on my website settle rotate the touch input so it's no longer off like this already got a copy of it on here touch write down SH execute that and your touch input should be aligned something to know is it's hard-coded to expect that you booted with this mouse option in the middle not in gamepad mode if you were in gamepad mode this touch script would need to be slightly different so Mickey use this script just make sure you boot with the mouse mouse pad mode or you'll be confused why doesn't work now let's go to my website and download those kernel rpms all right it might not look like this considering there's not much here but I'm gonna go ahead and download my rpms that I need I have all the kernel packages downloaded I'm gonna go ahead and pseudo zipper in dot slash colonel asterisk all right now that the kernel is installed let's go into yeah so yes then we want the bootloader in the bootloader can fit in our kernel parameters whatever you have in here just append the same things we've been appending so this command line or this kernel option and this kernel option as well as the DMI product name equals GPD win all right so a couple things we need to do here hit ye and then scroll down to your Linux line again so it should say something like lineage EFI boot VM lineage and then a bunch of options if you don't have the GPD win plus the end then it's it's not the right colonel you need to specify which colonel in your your grub config file assuming that that did work and your command-line options are in that mess of options you can select f10 again to boot alright so another thing that I had to do in order to get the headphone jack working properly I had to blacklist this HDMI audio assuming you're not going to need to have sound through HDMI your headphone jack just won't work right unless you do this so let's go ahead and edit this file on my GPD win and add this line ok nothing too fancy I'm gonna go ahead and reboot again so my touch screen is still off aligned every time I restart that's a easy fix I'm just gonna add that script to my startup config so in here startup startup applications then add I'll type in the name of fix and then command I'm going to go to browse select they touch right Sh script which will be on my website make sure that it has execute permissions so it can run as a program hit ok add close and let's restart again ctrl backspace just restarts your x11 session so that'll allow me to log in without having to reboot entirely hooray things are working touchscreens working Internet's working sound is working Firefox is working thanks for watching

=== Tip calculator | Codecademy walkthrough E03 ===

let's go over the wallet calculator project from Codecademy alright step 1 set up a variable called meal and set it to forty four point five okay 54 point five zero set up some tax tags gets six point seven five divided by 100 now that's not exactly how I would do this calculation so we're gonna do it two ways the way that they're trying to have us be taught and the most common way I'll add and in the crazy way that I want to do it so tax one is just gonna be six point seven five no divided by 100 we'll use it later okay and then we're gonna set up for two 'ti fifteen percent and do note that I purposefully put a decimal in there this is Python 2 we want to force float division instead of integer division actually it's not Python to base at all it's kind of being interpreted to JavaScript on this website so it's it's fine but it's kind of like Python two in that in the sense that it likes to do integer division when integers are given okay so now we're gonna do it my way tip just gets 15 so then we're going to modify the mule variable to include the tax so you'll get mule loss the result being plucked by text that will adjust the mill variable to include d tax then there's the way that I'm gonna do it that's nothing like the way they would have you do it which is all our gets forty four point let's just do panel divided by all members so break up the middle cost into 100 parts and then pull out six of those parts makes more sense to my brain there's six point seven five so then we can do they'll get you know plus male part x tax one which is the six point seven five value okay and then so these two lines is kind of equivalent to their one-liner so I guess my ways inefficient and bad but whatever now for their way they want and you'll get what do we put total total get meal in Pentheus by the way the parentheses are just for me I think it's prettier order of operations would do the multiplication first anyway but it is definitely prettier this way and it's just going to be you know x tax and we don't like that way so yep my way you have to update mill part right here then we can do me and gets an ax whole gets meal loss yeah our x our tip swift a print out the total save that and that is the value we were hoping for so fifty four point six two let's go ahead and prove that their way works too so comment out this this and make that this this and that well this is supposed to be a tip so we'll just modify that and this is supposed to be tip one so well update that it's or stress fun thanks for watching

=== SuSE and Yast ===

so yes tis getting a lot of kind of sick of it it's a powerful tool if you know how to use it and more importantly when to use it first off we've got our software repositories this is wonderful please don't remove this tool you can hit add community repository and here you can add your nvidia driver repository your pac-man repository which if you don't know is incredibly useful I've added it through other means so it doesn't show up here but you can absolutely add it through here I wouldn't say it's ugly or bad another time to use you asses if you want to install patterns or search for patterns so software management you can search for packages in here but I mean that's a good way to find like one-off packages but not big packages like matei if you want that go go to view patterns once you're in here you can go ahead and just select which desktop environment she wants if I wanted to install KDE plasma 5 I would select this and it would go ahead and select a shitload of packages for me then I go to accept and I'm done or of course you can do the one off by going to search and then let's say I wanted to install is on top of everything which I've clearly already done but yeah you can just select things in here it's oddly reminiscent of the synaptic package manager' back in the aboon two days so honestly I can't give it any this is a very robust graphical interface to your repositories however I just use it for most of the time another really useful tool is the boot loader this works really well in a two route if you break your system and in fact I would definitely not recommend taking this out of the system it's a powerful tool that I wish RedHat would have something like rather than just a command-line install grub which works most of the time but this will regenerate all the config files for me as well as install grub so if I have a broken grub I would chew root my system come into here and just just hit okay and it's gonna just gonna configure my bootloader for me that's beautiful that's useful it also has an okay partition er um it's like the Installer partitioner it'll get the job done but G part it's better the sis config editor might be a little bit weird if you're not used to Susa but it is actually really useful so yeah sis config this is where you can change things like your display manager your window manager see what I'm using light DM okay if the other day it's just an easy way to set up your config for su say another time this can be useful is if you want to set up a file share I mean you can do that with config files and yes it will overwrite config files if you configure it manually and then try to use yes that would be a bad plan but hey it makes things simple if you don't want to dick around in a config file forever so a lot of people say it's ugly that's kind of true it's really ugly in a terminal but what and curses application isn't a little ugly so when you first open yes in a terminal this is what you're greeted with it's actually pretty easy to navigate and you can do all the same things you can do with the graphical version with the end curses version so arrow keys to navigate tab to switch between areas shift tab to go the opposite direction to any area so this goes back where shift tap goes backwards tab goes forwards backwards forwards and it all just loops around so tab to the area you want then select down to whatever let's say I want to do some software management I've got a software management software management alright from here if I wanted to go to patterns I would hit shift tab and that takes me to the filter down arrow lets me select in this menu and I just simply arrow up to patterns enter and then I select whatever I want if I wanted to install and Lichtman I could I just hit enter on that and that and then I could hit tab a bunch of times all the way to accept and hit enter that's valid but notice that some of the menu items have a yellow letter like this one and this one this one if you hold down the Alt key and then press whatever a key is in yellow it will trigger that so alt a auto selects the accept and if I do alt oh it auto selects okay but I don't want to so I'm going to alt see this and then I'll see again and then all T Y so as you can see it's actually pretty intuitive and easy once you know what you're doing when not to use last well honestly yes will get in the way more often than not if you're just installing simple things so if you can get away with just using zipper on the command line you should if you really want to probe around your repositories or if you want to add a community repository or install an application that's part of a larger package group then yes tis definitely the thing you're gonna want to use and if you're wrong upon its watching

=== Linux Phone Upgrade | Comet +1 ===

hello and welcome Mecca just had a live stream covering a bunch of updates they're putting in their mobile Linux device and now it's a phone and it's got an npu let's cover the highlights the biggest news is a complete platform upgrade they're moving from the imx8 mini to the imx8 plus it's still a quad core CPU but it has some nice upgrades with this platform Improvement the GPU gets a nice boost this GPU supports openg glees 3.1 and Vulcan kind of right now the open source drivers support openg glees 2.0 and Mecca is actively working with the open source Community to get Vulcan and a newer version of openg running memory and storage is getting a nice upgrade too from 4 gigs of RAM to 8 gigs of RAM and from 32 gigs of onboard storage to 64 pretty nice they also have support for an SD card in case you want to Chuck in a couple extra terabytes but here's where things get really interesting they've upgraded their pcie slot to 3.0 and changed the keying to b key this means you can plug in a proper modem and there's more space around the modem meaning the support for modem should be better than the libram 5 okay now for the display technology they've switched to AMOLED which looks gorgeous but does potentially suffer from Burnin so you got to be careful not to like leave a terminal up for hours on end they managed to make the device thinner going from 16 mm down to 14 mm but they had to cut the ethernet port they also changed the USB ports to USBC ports on the front front they removed the male Pogo pins and replac them with female pins which will be much more durable on the device itself this way the modules will have mail pins and if there's any damage to those mail pins it'll be on the module and not the phone protecting the phone from potential wear to handle all this amazing new hardware they manage to squeeze in a battery that's 30% bigger they're projecting that this will take the battery life from 4 to 5 hours to 6 to 7 hours now here's the catch this is going to drag out the timeline sum they're projecting first prototypes will land in May and they're being smart about their Kickstarter launch they want to wait until they can demonstrate working Hardware the price will also be increased compared to what they originally projected I think they said something like 30% potentially this has truly become a successor to the libr 5 outperforming its processor and adding in additional capabilities like the modular hardware and an npu not to mention that it has extra space around the modem so additional modems will be easier to drop in the first iteration of the developer dock are live and it takes you all the way through building their kernels and flashing their device CAD files are published and source code is available on their GitHub they are going to send out some of their prototype devices the same version that was at CES but they don't have that many as it is a prototype build still I'm hoping I'll be one of the ones they send a device to this is much more than just a spec bump they've completely redesigned their device around Community feedback while I'm a bit bummed about the timeline I'd rather they take their time rather than rush out a half-baked product what do you think about all these upgrades let me know in the comments below thanks for watching bye

=== Godot vs Armory3d vs UPBGE ===

I tested three open- Source game engines here's what I learned from the fastest option to the option with the best graphics in Armory 3D up Blender Game engine and gdau I created roughly the same 3D game based on the gameplay of Boulder 2D Boulder 2D is a simple Zerg game where you can grab walls jump off walls and shoot ironically Boulder was originally going to be 3D before the dev scaled it down to be a 2d game Armory 3D was the first game engine I really took the time to learn as a developer who writes mostly python code the node-based logic was a big turnoff for me I always considered any graphical language to be less powerful or not worth my time after learning Armory I was proved wrong it's actually a very powerful if a bit clumsy programming format once you understand what the nodes do wiping out a bit of game logic with just a few nodes can be very fun what ultimately drove me away from Armory was the bugs one such bug is is I can't seem to get sound workking without resorting to building a full release of the game but when you do build the game the performance is excellent I mean just look at this game playay here's 100 enemies and Armory has no issue with all those Ai and Laser balls 200 is too much but I bet you could get even more with a bit of tuning the graphics are okay but they're not as good as other engines I tested models inside of blender tended to look a lot different in game resulting in a lot of time tuning Armory 3D has the best set of exportable platforms from the web to console to mobile this has you set up next I gave the up Blender Game engine a go I decided to use logic nodes inside of up Blender Game engine because they were similar to Armory with one massive Advantage these nodes can execute Python scripts that can do anything within your game one downside to the up Blender Game engine nodes is logic seems to be forced to be handled per frame rather than add a trigger compared to Armory 3D the nodes are clumsy and a bit harder to use but they're still effective another big advantage to up Blender Game engine is the ability to use geometry nodes these can come in handy for things like terrain generation performance seems to be completely usable for smaller numbers but at around 30 AIS the game really starts to struggle though bits could be redone in a more efficient way the performance is what drove me to look for something else because this is built directly into blender and utilizes the blender rendering framework the games look just how you made them modeling the graphics in up Blender Game engine is the best of all three game engines I tested the big downside is the complete lack of 2D tools like basic buttons and menus in other words you have to use 3D assets to build out your menus exporting is limited you can run your games on Mac windows and Linux next I tested gdau my main reason for avoiding gdau was because of the use of GD script I wanted to write python codee or No Deal fortunately working with the other game engines broke me of my stubbornness so I swallowed the GD script shaped pill after using GD script I realized why the developers of gdau made it instead of using a pre-built option like python or Lua GD script is built for games vectors colors and game objects are first class while everything is still objectoriented the keyword self is nowhere to be seen as it's implied by being attached to a game object GD script is just like python if python were Rewritten for gamedev gdau was the fastest of all the engines I tested buttery smooth gameplay with normal numbers of AIS and it can handle 100 AIS just fine like with Armory 200 was about the limit I already have a few ideas on how to limit the number of active script which could increase the AI count a lot Graphics are on par with up Blender Game engine but with a disadvantage of things looking slightly different when imported from other other tools like blender gdau lets you export to Mac Windows Linux mobile and the web better than up Blender Game engine but not as good as Armory 3D overall I had a lot of fun learning these engines Armory is a good starting place and has excellent node logic perfect for someone hesitant to dive into programming but still wanting to learn Game Dev Armory also has a very good set of export platforms the up Blender Game engine has all the power of blender and python at your fingertips perfect for a python fanatic like I used to be gdau is well-rounded with decent performance perfect for making bigger games gdau also has a lot of community plugins some of which are crazy amazing like always this is free software and you can find the links in the description below thanks for watching bye

=== Managing Linux Shell Processes ===

hello and welcome back everybody I'm going to show you how to manage processes in a Linux terminal all right so let's say you started a process that blocks your terminal for example here's my text editor cases use it nice but you'll notice my terminal is locked out now there's a way I could have prevented that I'm gonna use control-c to kill it that killed Kate it's gone but if I wanted to still be able to use this terminal I couldn't I can type in the command and an ampersand that says put this in the background on startup so there it is I still have shell access and Kate is running i'm telling some file and i want to put this in the background but i've argued on the command you can press ctrl-z which will freeze or stop the program then BG will put that into the background so yeah I can type in commands and I have two jobs running in the background right now if I type in a foreground it will foreground the last process which basically just means it's in its broken state it was in just before I had press ctrl-z in the first place so as if I were up here just having run tail so tel is in the foreground still waiting for tell to exit so control Z + BG we're back to two jobs in in in this show to see those jobs we can run jobs first job is Kate second job is tell we can kill those by typing in to kill and then % one for Kate and % to foretell in this case referenced here or if we want to foreground one of them we can do so simply by going like this or this depending if you want Kate or towel right here we've foreground Kate we can control see kill it and I killed it baking foreground again that will foreground tell kill its and job control thanks for watching

=== OneClick Install: The new beautiful way & the terminal way. ===

installing packages on openSUSE just got a lot prettier here's what I mean web browser okay so I want to install T Worlds that's just a Linux video game that I happen to like but it could be any package it could be a lib it could be any Linux dependency or regular open-source package so T worlds then I just come here and click on the Susa lizard icon which then goes to software openSUSE org and does a package search and as you can see it looks really good now the workflow isn't really that different but it does look nicer one-click install open yes next a bunch of times one password later installation successful it really is that easy oh I want to install docker then I just select get direct install it's so pretty it's very versatile but what is it really doing let me show ya alright so on top this file open with Kate and this is what the ymp file looks like so this file is pretty simple you've got two parts in the repository part it just has a bunch of definitions and summaries but most importantly has a URL in the software area the most important one is the name docker so if I wanted to not use yes to install this I could just open up a terminal switch over to root and zipper add repository that URL and then space the name we want to call this so the name is actually right here it's openSUSE factory so boom then we would do a zipper rough once our repositories are refreshed we can go ahead and and install the package name so it's already been done on this system with the GUI just a minute ago so if you were paying attention I did add a repository I already had that's kind of a no-no I should clean that up it's pretty easy zipper list repository and we still don't know - - URI okay great it's gonna be one of these that we just added so let's grep for the URL just this guy whoops forgot my grep we're up okay so from this output you can see we have two repositories the fourth repository and the sixth repository are duplicates honestly this one's uglier so I'm gonna delete that one zipper remove repository Arar and then for to be safe I'm going to refresh my repositories and now my computer's not screwed up you

=== Let's install | OpenSuSE Leap 15.0 ===

hello Internet openSUSE leap 15 has been released let me sell you on it so far it's nothing very hard man their servers are bogged down the heads not wedding frame Oh bitchin openSUSE 15 I heard some good about this one I have a very fast internet connection so we'll have a fairly good idea of what their servers were like under load hey five minutes really for four point seven gigabytes impressive so they recommend image writer I would rather use DD let's prepare I'm gonna use this thumb drive small tutorial tell us the SD tap tab gives me there's an SD a and an SD be I'm gonna insert my thumb drive tap tab SDC so clearly my thumb drive is dev SDC so the command should be DD if for input file gets tilde slash screw that home potato downloads what is this download openSUSE leap just that openSUSE I have so many of these week 15 dot ISO okay then it's just of equals slash dev slash SD and we decided because that's the new device when I plugged in my thumb drive see ya don't dad up oh but there's more nonsense that they want me to add equals or megabytes dude you need a diuretic status equals progress and first ampersand that's a dollar sign Dave Dave hey cat no and and sink you know if we all just remember to run the sink command before we ripped out our USB drives we would have a lot less weird data corruption can I run this command yet yeah it's downloaded and same thing okay so now we just get to wait until the ISO is written Godot key so 3.9 gigabytes copied and it ran the sink command no it didn't but now we're running the sink command cuz you should ring you should you should definitely run that sink command bro it's useful whoa yep geez look how much need sunk all right now that sink has been run I'm actually gonna reboot and install OBS over there on this fresh install of this okay here's the grub screen for the Installer we'll just go down to the installation option okay we are initializing let's go ahead and just spam the next key for a little bit next I'm gonna go ahead and just go with default KDE plasma for now you could also go to configure online repositories hit next a bunch of times go to custom and you can select xfce or matei if you so desire but for now I'm just gonna go ahead and go to next all right so the partitioner is gonna do btrfs by default that's cool if you want transactional upgrades which allows you to like roll back and have a read read only root filesystem but I don't even to that expert practitioner will do with existing disks so for me it's really easy I'm just going to replace one of the OSS I have on my fast drive which is one of these with with this openSUSE so all I'm gonna do is go in here or the bottom here and edit and we're gonna say do format this drive mount this drive as root next okay so now we're going to be using this as my root filesystem we need to set up s DB to be my home drive this is where my home data is and I don't want to have to move that around or do anything special so we're gonna this do not format mount slash home next except and it's just next a bunch of times the install went just fine I just finished installing OBS and adding my pac-man repos and I should talk about the pac-man repos these are the biggest gotcha in the openSUSE community in my personal opinion you forget to add these you're gonna probably have a bad experience and talk about how bad openSUSE is so note that if you use openSUSE please do this next step immediately after you install and what is that step go to a browser type in open Supes pac-man open Susa pac-man just like that first link additional repository and look here's the command notice that it changes the priority to 90 this is very useful so go ahead and add this I'm on 15 you were on a different version it would have it then run zipper refresh when it asks you if you want to trust the repository enter a four always and then your your system will have a lot more packages available and you'll have a just an easier time playing things like mp4s and you won't like rip your hair out it's also sometimes useful and by sometimes useful I mean like almost always useful to after you add the pac-man rabe repository to dupe from it distribution upgrade so run this command it's root I guess just run this command you run this command it'll say this package is broken do you want to bla bla bla you always enter one first which vendor until it installs everything and then you'll have a great time on openSUSE then I just installed OBS and Here I am so everything's working pretty good except I'm on the open drivers let's go ahead and switch to the Nvidia proprietary driver because I I like better acceleration just in general okay so I'll be honest I was trying to do the open Susu drivers easy way and it just wasn't working for me so I'm gonna go ahead and follow the hard directions which is Nvidia the hard way it's easy you just Google and do the hard way with Syria so it's the first link now we're gonna go ahead and give these commands or run install some patterns go for it and this is gonna install like the source code for my kernel and development crap needed to compile the kernel driver that will come with the Nvidia installer so while that's going we're gonna go ahead and keep reading these download the driver okay let's download the driver mine's a Geforce 1060 GeForce GTX 1060 for the Linux 64-bit operating system English yes looks like this is the right one for me download save file ok so now we have the Nvidia driver it's just a matter of getting the right dependencies installed and dot slashing that file with no GUI running oh yeah we need to do it without this so we're going to open them yost yes boot loader all right this is the bootloader config we can add kernel parameters in here this one okay so we're gonna add that option right here just like so okay it's gonna go ahead and regenerate my integer RT looks like we're fairly well installed here and I'm gonna go ahead and reboot to run level 3 ok post reboot I did for the source node the sympathies was installed at the right version so I updated my kernel as well with zipper top and then it was simple dot slash the Installer I had it regenerate my X config files and it worked really well it's running right now pretty anyway I hope you enjoyed openSUSE it's a great operating system there's a couple pickups you have to like know about if Dad pac-man depository and sometimes adding the proprietary drivers a bit tricky but overall I think you'll have a great time thanks for watching

=== Librem 5 Development Kit [First Look] ===

I managed to get my hands on the labrum v development kit and boy does it look great right out of the gate I noticed a couple of interesting things first the USB cable is purple not to be alone in the strange colors the power brick is orange so you get a purple USB in an orange power brick nice the power brick does have something interesting it can change to various different voltages like 12 volts or 5 volts and that's kind of interesting I've not seen that on a whole lot of power breaks and the next thing that blew my mind is it's not actually like a phone board and a libra my board it's just one board you can flip it over one side to screen one sides like a bunch of things processor eat zinc really one more on that later once we were satisfied gawking in it all of the included hardware we went ahead and plugged the device into a computer in short order a device called TTY ACM 0 showed up we used Pico comm to connect to this device and we were greeted with a wonderful purism login screen I used route route to login cat up the release file kind of poked about a bit and it seemed good to go from here it was time to upgrade so we went ahead downloaded the latest development scripts from purism and as well we needed to install something called you-you-you which I guess is required for the flashing process I wasn't able to find this in the openSUSE repositories but I believe it is at least in the Debian repositories in my case I had to compile from source and there was like three or four library dependencies as well as things like GCC and GCC EE C++ that needed to be installed in order for me to compile once compiled I linked the file to slash user bin switch the boot mode switch into USB and then I rebooted the device ran the script and it downloaded the latest build from their Jenkins server and flashed the device just fine after that we switched the device back into emmc mode and rebooted it grabbed my micro HDMI to HDMI adapter unfortunately it had a right bend in it which then blocked the USB C port which powers the device so we were stuck with serial for the moment and needed to pick up additional parts but from serial console we were able to tell that it did install the new OS so naturally we checked the temperature and notice it's getting really really hot once it hit up around 56 degrees we figured we should probably wait and put a fan on this especially if you want to do anything a little bit more intensive on the device so we put this on hold for the moment we need to go ahead and get ourselves a mini HDMI to HDMI adaptor that doesn't have a band as well as a fan and a few other bits and bobs anyway thanks for watching bye

=== Python | Codecademy walkthrough E02 ===

continuing where I left off before let's keep learning okay this is going over one of the most confusing early concepts of coding let's go over it in a console though instead let's set the variable I'll test one GATS ten now if we want to modify what is in test one of people starting I don't think this is acceptable it's 20 isn't it and you know it's it's still 10 if you want to increment what's inside of test one you have to reassign test one and what does that look like looks like this test one gets passed one plus ten I think we can all agree that test one gets test one does nothing right it's the same it says store what sinuan already but if we do test one mine is that we're actually modifying your very cool tada oh look they're using syntax I haven't gone over yet let's go over some of the syntax so they're plus gets syntax here which is what we see here plus gets test 1 plus gets 5 and test 1 it's shorthand for test 1 it gets test 1 plus so if you if you don't want to have to type out the variable twice one on the what we're storing in and one on the assignment side of the gets then you can simply ignore that and do plus equals 5 alright instruction of all's we're trying to figure out how much it rained in the past year update annual rainfall variable to include the values from September to December so annual rainfall cats annual rainfall plus plus pop and this plus bluffin this and yeah you can just keep adding like this although if the line gets too long it's gonna be pretty ugly so just be aware of how long your lines are getting and break this up pretty easily by adding another annual rainfall gets annual rainfall Plus that and do another one that's annual rainfall gets annual rainfall plus the next one and so on but this one liner should do the trick give it run oh we have September twice gotta make sure we do that right let's take October replace this one I'll beat it back mmm wrong let's continue they are 100% right you do need to comment your code commenting your code is super useful for anyone who's gonna read it later which includes yourself a lot of the times so we're gonna do some comments here unfortunately I don't think either of these things really need commented because it's pretty obvious the variable names we're getting assigned something is is almost a comment in and of itself but set name that city let's give that a run well it seems to not care but yeah you can tell you what you can tell what each thing is doing you could even do this just set city info and then you can move on with the program this code anyway um you do whatever you want but I usually have kind of a comment on top of the blocks that do something so this is like pretending or this is the block or set out the city information and we can have a block code that processes all that information next numbers you guys I already know all of this so integer holds something doesn't have a decimal including zeroes and negatives floats are something to have a decimal so I had no idea this was true but yeah you can do scientific notation so 1.5 ^ to slide that decimal 1 2 you got 150 that's cool I've never used that probably cuz I don't use that large of numbers that often but you can there going grocery shopping let's make a grocery list so that you can plan your budget so we're gonna take cucumbers cucumbers gets let me do I want I think I want 42 cute compass all right each cucumber is gonna cost me want rice per you gets three point two five okay before we move on any more I'm gonna talk about how much it annoys me the way they do their variable names Codecademy Codecademy Kok Adam II anyway I would if I were writing this program camelcase my variables instead of under like underscore them so the difference would be rice for you I think it looks better and just just as like clean I see both pretty commonly but visit just at the alternative way of doing it so you pick which one looks prettiest to you do note though that this code Academy place is going to require you to use these underscores for the time being because it's that's how they check if the programs execute it right say check for variable names which aren't camel cased unfortunately alright we got the third part so now we want to set the total cost to 42 it's just a cucumber value and the price per cucumber that's a plus sign David that's multiplication sign so we're doing 32 multiplied by three point two five and stowing that in total and it's gonna parse out what's in total and tell us we're doing it right oh it wants us to print it print I feel like being an ass again that's okay I'm on no I'm totally gonna be done time forty two x three point two five one thirty six point five and because I'm not a lazy person let's typecast that with all the parentheses we need oh it didn't like that what if we do this does that let us trick their parser yes it does what no all right let's do this they're going over integer division and regular division I kind of did that in the last video but let's see how they go over it wrong so I don't know if this has changed in Python 3 or what let's actually test that test that - - oh it is a thing that's different in Python 2 versus Python 3 now that would get a little confusing the maths I'm sure but yeah what they're saying is back in the Python 2 days if you divide an integer by a different integer it's going to always do intricate division now on the Python 3 days if you want that to happen you need to typecast the results store like that so let's go back to Python 3 set up 7/2 look at the quotient and you see it's 3.5 and less we type past it so that definitely is a difference between Python 2 and 3 keep it in mind all right so integer division is useful that does have scenarios but you do need to kind of force it in Python 3 giving you a couple more rundown of how to typecast make it a float so that it comes out yep yep yeah okay so you have come home from the grocery stores with 100 cucumbers to split amongst yourself and five roommates six people total create a variable called cucumbers with six 100 on people hold six okay so we're just gonna do it the Python 3 method cucumbers divided by number of people and we've been that out thanks all right gotta spell everything right David okay so let's go over this program real quick we're setting up cucumbers at 100 and I'm people with six then we're taking we're doing some integer division figuring out how many whole cucumbers there are per person storing it in here and then printing that out yes this was some pretty ugly variable names okay and then it wants us to figure out how many leftovers there are so then we're gonna take this set it to cucumbers use numbers modulus the number of people so we're doing in true division here we're getting the truncated integer of of how many each person could use and then we're saying what was left over with modulus so it's going to do the division and then it since it doesn't go and even it'll divide divide divide by to be like oh here's left over doesn't divide equally and then there's your modulus I don't know that makes any sense but it makes a lot of sense to me so spread that out anyway don't we just print out this really long very one I don't want Ike wrong so there it is number of people some people cool oh it doesn't want the remainder of the cucumber's of how many's left over it just wants one of these to be a float so that it's that's superdumb but I've cast oops give that a run and we're not doing modulus anymore so okay they should have done the modulus because I don't want to reinforce modulus a little but they didn't so we're just gonna move on from that next multi-line strings this is a string a pound is a comment a single quote or Dipple quotes what's stuck in between them is a single line string and then if you want a multi-line string you can one two three but whatever the hell you want to bend eight lines as you want one two three to end back you can set this up like test gets this and then test would print out that garbage plop that on into here yeah you can see it it just does that but if you know if we print this it'll look a little better there we go backslash n is the new line character is equivalent to the Enter key without actually having an Enter key yep interesting tidbit there are a couple of use cases from multi-line strings one is this you want to assign a variable of something that's more than one line alternative to this would be with the backslash ends backside and so that's the same as well with the single quote or the single set of double quotes and then the other use case is if you want to comment something that's multiple lines as I went over last video you can have a floating string in your program it just doesn't do anything so if you have any really long comment you want to say and don't want to want to put a pound beginning of each line a multi-line comment is pretty common to use lots I don't know but you can just put in as much comment as you want there and then continue with it so the downside to having a long floating string in your program is it isn't overly efficient you are just arbitrarily wasting memory to have a string there but they didn't ever implement a multi-line string besides that's their multi-line comment besides that so it is what it is yeah let's see what they want us to make those do create a variable like you get in highlighting this I've noticed that mine has a space here while theirs does not have a space here I find that immensely frustrating and I think early users would find that pretty frustrating too ok Codecademy you shouldn't give a crap if there are empty spaces in here at all so I wouldn't I would make your parser a smidge bit better it wouldn't be that hard you would just need to look through each line and do a strip statement you could write it in like 15 lines of code I don't know how many people would get stuck here with little spaces and weird places but it's a waste of everyone's time so moving on bullying's are another variable type and there's also something called boolean logic that we can go into a smidge bit as well so let's pop over into this console and do true/false all right those are the two boolean expressions that exist we can store them true get true/false s-pulse so I have a variable name true that holds the boolean value of true I hope that's not too confusing they are just arbitrary by variable names I could just put false to here as well it's not a problem but something I couldn't do or something you shouldn't do is put a capital F there because that's just weird don't use there are certain things you should just not use as variable names and true and false is one of them all right one of the most common things you're gonna use boolean's for our if statements so you say if some boolean statement so let's just do true hi okay of course it printed hi because if true is true but we could also have done if false or true still sets hi so it's saying if this is set to true or if this is set to true and no it will check both but it will short-circuit so if this was true it wouldn't ever check this because it's looking for one or the other it can be both but it doesn't give a damn it if it's both so if we wanted it to be if you want true and true we'd have to do it false and and that does nothing oh let's do something cooler if I was do test cats well if test is greater than six Flint and since 12 is greater than six this boolean expression is evaluated as true so it comes out with saying if true print hi but if we set test to four and rerun the above expression it doesn't do anything I'm sure it's gonna go a little bit deeper into boolean expressions so let's just keep eating up whatever they say this is a really weird example they're asking us to read this and see that this person is 21 and then because they're 21 gauge is 12 balls that all we're doing here okay very loose touch on bullying expressions there this slide is almost exactly what I've done before playing in a console it's talking about typecasting so in this line age is 13 I am at the age a string of five years old that's super ironic that they use that example - okay um let's just skip down to whatever it's making us do create a variable called product that contains a result of multiplying the float value of float one and two how was that heart multiply is a star plus as a plus really ought to get that right David okay now it wants us to create a large string that has the data this but where that is a string like this and because I want to see that run that well it's 10 and since I'm terribly interested to see their parsing abilities it seems to not care about that pretty cool let's just move on though all right so we've looked at a bunch of stuff let's just do their test why not create a variable called skill completed set it equal to some Python syntax and then run and then stage to create a variable called exercise is completed and set it equal to 13 13 don't forget to delete this backslash points per exercise gets 5 sub - okay create variable called point total and set it to 100 update total point to be what it was before plus the result what update total point to be what it was before plus the result of multiplying exercise completed and points per exercise we initialize the total points here to 100 update total points to be what it was before not initialized plus the and per points per day I'll be honest their directions here are pretty bad pretty bad I don't even know if this is what it's looking for yeah okay it wants a face total of the points just totally gonna fudge this and just because I like cleanliness I like to put parentheses around the things I want to execute first rather than letting it happen automatically so we're going to multiply these two and then add 100 points per exercise we're gonna add a comment here that says this oh there's your comment happy with that print a string to the console that says I got whatever points okay rinse I should show you some of the cool ass Python 3 syntax for printing out variable names and level of strings it's pretty awesome do that another time though print alright dot plus and a space points exclamation mark I should do it 165 points all right well that sounds like a very good stopping thanks for watching bye

=== Containerization on Linux Phones ===

while recently learning about cube's os i was amazed at how containerization of apps files and workflows could add in so much extra security if you don't know cubezos is an os where a vm called dom0 runs a gui and can start apps from other vms you control which vms have access to the internet and they all have their own files anyway it's a cool os that uses lots of vms just because i like messing around with containers and graphical environments i set out to create a similar setup for the library 5. cubes os uses a base os of fedora but i'll just use pure os as a base and build on top of that this script checks you're running his root then runs a debian build script this builds a debian 11 chew root and installs fosh it's then copied to far lib container the script finishes by setting up the system d and spawn files with all that set up we can start our half-baked dom zero as an app in our normal fosh session this kind of nesting is super cool it seems to be using the x wayland window to display the second fast session okay but the base os isn't really meant to do anything except run vms the gui is supposed to be run inside of dom0 while this is kind of cheating it was pretty simple just to edit the user bin phos script with a simple edit and the system ctl command the gui is off but fock is running from within the dom zero container this is all that's needed to start the foss session it does display a mouse cursor and you have to disable docked mode in order to get the on-screen keyboard icon to appear still this is really cool while this is a far cry from the advanced cubes os dom0 it's a start that could be built up on to add a similar security model that cubesos has all of this is gpl and simple code if you have use of setting up an nspawn container or if you need a debian build script this is a decent project to dig into thanks for watching bye

=== Librem 5 | Gaming ===

sebastien one of the badass devs over at piers him messed around with some common open-source games on the labrum 5 let's check out what he got running and go over some of the useful tweaks he used in order to get these games up and going all credit for this goes to Sebastian it is truly amazing what an experienced developer can do in such a short amount of time do note applying some of these tweaks have side effects it is good practice to have a valid backup and it's not a bad idea to check out the steps to reflash the phone if something does go wrong if you're not feeling that adventurous don't worry some games do work out of the box for example scummvm this gives you the ability to run a large amount of classic old point and click games there's also a handful of gnome games that just work 2048 Ches lights off you and this slighty game you can also run boiled corn which does look like some fun on the go you can even play some web browser-based games if you're looking to get your dance on non-competitive singing potatoes is the app you're looking for it's rather creative and funny if spiders don't freak you out spider disco also works without modification the first useful hack is messing with the hid pie scaling this can be done by creating a folder copying a file to that folder then editing that file a bit I'm not really sure which of these need edited so I'll just do them all then you can simply reboot the phone or to save time just restart Fache and everything is small the login screens hilariously small and once logged in all the icons are small so yeah if you're not too afraid of a small UI this does help a number of games for example Vegas the UI is small but it still looks like fun the battle for wesnoth also looks pretty good on the labrum five in small desktop mode the menus in never ball look absolutely perfect on a touchscreen but the ball controls themselves barely function I would love to see gyro controls implemented in this game edge Wars is also playable but it did take a bit of extra work to get that touch input working nicely done sometimes the issues aren't graphical or even touch related but the game is instead built for a keyboard for those games you can swap out the default keyboard for vert board which offers arrow keys and a few other useful keyboard inputs to swap out the keyboard simply install vert board then just edit this file a bit this is a super simple script and it could be a lot of fun to hack in a joypad with a couple buttons you can also run frozen bubble it helps to set a chai dpi to 1 and of course use this alternative keyboard super tux is also playable with hid PI plus vert board enabled Mesa 19.3 is not included by default in pls just yet but if you're feeling adventurous you can try building a root filesystem of some other distro and simply change route into the new environment here's what I did apt installed a bootstrap then build a chi root of debian CID then do the nominal G root stuff I'm actually not positive how to install Mesa 19.3 but it should be possible from this environment but with Mesa 19.3 you can play a few more games for example super tux cart the UI is very usable and gameplay is not just passable but you can actually play and win a match I can't wait for this to be easily installable I'll totally be playing this on the go any match also benefits from some of the 19.3 Mesa it's nice to see such a polished game running so early into the release of the Libra 5 as you can see the state of gaming on the Libra 5 is improving day by day what games do you want to see port up to the leap from 5 thanks for watching bye

=== The First Distro | H.J.Lu's bootable rootdisk for Linux ===

back in the early days of computing the logic that runs computers was hidden away and sold only to those that had enough money this kind of works if you have a business use case for every computer but it rightly pissed off a large number of computer programmers just wanting to understand modify or reuse some locked away secret program Richard Stallman was known for fighting against software patents and in 1985 started the canoe project by releasing his call to action now with a fearless leader chosen we the people started work towards rewriting what was largely inaccessible to the general public while applications make up a large amount of what computers can do it gets nowhere without a kernel at the end of the day the kernel is exposing hardware to the software the sled software developers target kernels instead of individual hardware platforms while the freedom respecting OS called canoe started developing its own kernel in 1990 shortly after linus torvalds started developing his own OS called freaks which then was renamed to Linux Linux and canoe merged forces once Linux took on the GPL license in 1992 anyway let's take a look at where this all started to come together HJ loos bootable root disk for Linux is widely considered the first distribution this puppy was built for an AI 386 computer with a 5.2 inch floppy drive I don't own any hardware that can run this but we can emulate this with PC eeehm you okay P CEM is not that good at reading floppies did you know that DOSBox is an AI 386 emulator I wonder if we can get this to handle Linux oh wow Lila I didn't expect that this brings me back to the days when Celeste 10 was still supported and I worked for Novell doing SUSE Linux technical support I think grub was a lot easier to work with although I only got a handful of calls with people using lie low so it seems DOSBox does not like booting Linux I'm not sure how motivated those devs were when it came to hard drive controllers but it's cool to see the different error messages from the very old versions of Linux to the still very old versions of Linux I'm not sure why I didn't try qemu first but this has been installed in my system for a long time QEMU had no issue running at all once I figured out this command this early operating system looks a lot like the modern operating system that powers most of the internet pretty cool for the earliest thing that you can call a distro on login you agreed with an ASCII Bart Simpson this was distributed on floppies as a bootable root disk you could install it to a hard drive but that was targeted towards the more technically minded this early version of Linux is a cool sandbox you can play around in it's interesting to see how many of the core ideas are already in place /bin has a bunch of binary programs these are all command line based /hz is full of system settings like FS tab which contains a list of disks that need e mounted on boot that's the issue seems to be the closest thing to a release file that I'm going to find /dev looks very similar to how it does today except the device names aren't as dynamic they seem to show placeholders that don't point at real Hardware a lot of the block devices don't actually seem to be real devices I'm not sure why I'm using tty 0 &amp; tty 1 but you can see that computer magic here is working you can even take notes with VI just like a lot of modern Linux users do today some commands don't work 100% the way I expected them to tab autocomplete is not implemented in this shell which does slow things down quite a bit Wow proc is empty switching over to a newer version of this project we can see there are more of the files we'd expect to see in slash Brock the kernels virtual memory map k core is rather small I think that's around 64 megabytes in total this newer version also includes a few more programs and a few fragmented help pages shut down didn't act quite as I was expecting leaving me with this message all in all it's very interesting to see where this minimalistic OS started the tools included are rather limited but it seems the only way to install additional software back in 1992 was to copy source files and build it yourself the important takeaway here is this was the first freedom respecting operating system made by people for people thanks for watching bye

=== 6 ways to reboot Linux ===

hello and welcome back everybody I'm gonna give you the best ways to reboot a Linux server so starting with the most obvious reboot halt power all of those do the same thing but also shut down - ash are those are the clean ways to shut down a server you can also use the init system like init 6 that says switch to the run level reboot that will also reboot your server but let's say shits broken I hope you have magic keys enabled because those are really useful in a system like this you just have to remember reboot even if system entirely broken and to execute these all you do is you hold down alt sis RQ and you press each of these keys but here's what it does it takes control of your keyboard back from x11 useful to capture the rest of your keystrokes then it sends the please shut down to your processes then it says shut down not so nicely and then it syncs your data to your disk this is the real important one you want this to happen and in fact you could honestly just do s U and B instead but it's better to do all of them it announced the system read-only and then it forced reboots the server immediately you could also do a C here instead which would just shut down the server instead of reboot that's the ways I know how to shut down a Linux server thanks for watching you

=== Librem 5 | Temperatures and Runtime ===

let's take a look at the power and heat situation of the leave'em five here is what the two versions look like while charging with a small fan blowing on them on the right we have the older birch version of the labrum five with the newer chestnut on the left both are up to date and running pure OS as you can see the chestnut is performing much better running around five degrees cooler than the birch even with the birch closer to the fan a more real-world test is charging without a fan oh my goodness fan goes back on let's kill this phone as soon as this recording is done based on this test I would not recommend charging a birch without a fan or at least some sort of metal surface for it to rest on to carry away some of that heat this really shows just how much better the chestnut version of the Liebherr 5 is at cooling the phone charges safely more than 10 degrees cooler than the version before just as important as heat dissipation is battery life without any modification running Wi-Fi and with the modem turned off the chestnut lasted 2 hours 20 minutes and 30 seconds this can be extended by turning off a few CPU cores and limiting the CPU frequency with that done the chestnut lasted 2 hours 34 minutes and 20 seconds which gives us an extra 13 minutes and 50 seconds of runtime the few CPU tweaks that have applied were the only things I could think of to do on my own but I went over to the matrix channel and asked what they might do in order to save some battery life Sebastian came back with a few extra commands for me to try these commands allow us to set the DRAM governor to allow the clock speed to drop to 25 megahertz warning this does cause issues with the display stack at the moment but as an extra step let's go ahead and turn off the screen by hitting that power button once with the CPU and DRAM in a minimal state the chestnut lasted three hours 41 minutes and 20 seconds which is a whopping 1 hour and 20 minutes and 50 seconds extra this leads us to the next question can the device keep itself cool while under load I started stress testing the Leoben 5 and walked away for about 30 minutes when I got back the CPU was hotter than I liked but once I stopped the test the CPU dropped in temperature very fast playing with the CPU and DRAM like we did before does seem to be an effective way to keep the Liebherr 5 cool this is what the Libre 5 looks like under load but with the DRAM and CPU in a minimal state the temperature stays between 50 and 52 degrees not too bad this is really good news it means that at some point the Libre 5 will be able to manage its own temperature simply by reducing performance the upcoming version dogwood should have even better cooling than what we see in chestnut we should also keep in mind that the final version evergreen will come with a bigger battery than what we're testing with today thanks for watching bye

=== Correcting Commands ===

if this hasn't scared you away yet then I've got some useful tricks for you to correct those mistyped commands so let's say you type in something that's supposed to be pseudo but it's not pseudo you can go ahead and put a carrot the long coat onco thing and the right thing so that's a search and replace as in search for replace and specifically the last run command ok great you get how that works now let's say you did the exact same damn thing but you don't want to have to type that in because who wants to practice a muscle memory for that nobody does so the right answer is pseudo and an exclamation mark and a star that says run sudo with the arguments of the previous command previous command arguments of the previous command ok but there's actually a lot of these like exclamation mark and then symbol things I'm gonna go ahead and show you all of those but do that I'm not going to show you all of those I'm gonna show you some of them geez there's a lot of them umm echo AVCHD if you want the first element we can do exclamation mark and then a character that's the element a if we want the last one is its echo exclamation mark and a dollar sign okay if we want the third element the syntax is echo exclamation mark colon three and do note that's not zero-based it's literally going to be the third element and that's because there is no third element so it's rerun this and then rerun parent : the third okay last example and it's probably the best one or maybe most useful ones so if you remember any of these just carry this out with you let's let's pretend you're looking for a final oh there's those jar files you want a CD to this directory now you don't have to re-type out that path that's silly and you don't have to like Barrow control a delete Eevee I mean you can control a over there and do that but I would recommend that you just type in CD and then you hold the alt or the escape key and hit period that will do a very similar thing to have the exclamation mark dollar sign behaved in our previous example now but you can continue to press a note toggle through more of the arguments it's very useful and should save you a lot of typing thanks for watching bye you

=== 3d Printing a Phone Case ===

it's a good idea to keep your valuables safe and your phone is no different let's go over how i slap together a libra 5 case when it comes to 3d printing multiple iterations are just about always needed this is my first attempt to make a lever 5 case it's too small not very thick and the holes are in the wrong place clearly i would need to make a few adjustments in blender i ended up applying the solidify modifier to add thickness to the case this worked well except that it added a triangle artifact the solution was to apply the solidify modifier then select the top faces around the issue and then scale the z-axis to zero more fine adjustments and it was time to add a top lip as bit worried about adding the lip without support material but it seems to have printed okay without it with the case designed and working on the dogwood release i expect this to be completely trivial to update for the evergreen mass production run as a bonus the skills i learned in this project let me print a perfectly usable replacement toilet handle for those looking to get into 3d printing with open source software head on over to the 3d printing professor part of animation here's a fantastic tutorial on how to set up blender 2.8 for 3d printing has a powerful set of tools for doing that phonic the audiobook player i've been building for mobile linux has seen a lot of bug fixes to name a few chapter skipping bugs have been resolved and moving the audiobook's location no longer breaks the bookmarks i also added in a few new features the chapter names are now displayed and i've added in a basic sleep timer to auto pause the player after so many minutes the latest version is available on my bitbucket as a dot dev contributions as code or feedback are more than welcome and since the dot dev just contains python this should run on just about any debian or ubuntu-based system including across architectures like arm and x86 head on over to hackers-game to find out more thanks for watching bye

=== Librem 5 Chestnut | Apps ===

hardware changes from birch to chestnut are small but have a nice usability improvement on the outside the two models of the Libre 5 looked the same but you'll notice a difference when you plug in the leap from fives on the birch batch it doesn't enter a charging State when you plug it in while off at least not automatically this is fixed in Chestnut when I first plugged in the chestnut it auto powered on this new model can and does charge just fine while in an off state the chestnut also seems to have a bit better heat dissipation but both devices still get pretty hot I've a thermal camera coming next week that should better be able to tell if there are improvements calling on the Libre 5 is spotty it will work one moment and then the next not at all but when it does work it has a few issues the proximity sensor doesn't lock the screen so your face is pretty likely to mess with the UI holding the phone like a normal person seems to result in no audio getting across I ended up holding the phone like an old person in order to get the audio to work right I'm guessing this has something to do with the echo reduction and should be fixable in software this is a test of the call audio quality on a leap and by texting can be inconsistent but I found it to be much more reliable than calling it basically always works if you toggle the hardware baseband switch the mobile-data works really well while I'm out and about but when I'm in my apartment the Liebherr 5 thinks I'm attached to 4G and even gets an IP address from t-mobile but no data works on the phone including Wi-Fi I have to disable mobile data for the Wi-Fi to work stability was also an issue when I first got the Libra 5 Chestnut I think this was because the power status is not always reported correctly this means that the OS might think that a phone is charging when it is actually unplugged and vice-versa the auto suspend feature in conjunction with the improper reported battery state is causing the instability but that's just a guess after I disable automatic suspend the Libra 5 will work as long as it's powered and not too hot during this week I hadn't time of three days but with updates coming in as often as they do it's best practice just to reboot daily headphones on both the birch and chestnut only kind of work you can get sound to play over them but they will be accompanied with heavy static Bluetooth is working very well I have struggled with Bluetooth on lots of phones but this was the best experience I've had so far I turned on the headset went into settings and connected it the hardest part was I had to remember to switch my output device to be the Bluetooth headset Firefox can now be used on the labrum 5 you'll need to use the alternative keyboard though check out my last video for directions you'll also need to set up an environment variable which can be done by editing this dot desktop file with that done the web browser works amazingly well the scrolling works pretty quick and you can even watch things like mV phonic the audiobook player I've been working on now it looks much better and is even packaged as a dot Deb but this leads me to another issue the package war of the labrum v is somewhat unsettled some are packaging as flat pack while others like myself are packaging as dot M getting your dot dab into the Debian repository is one way to publish for the labrum v but that is not a simple process the labrum 5 is now using the mainline version of Mesa which should eventually enable 3d acceleration for flat packs which will be a supported way to publish at some point if you don't want to wait for flat pack and you don't want to work directly with Debian developers you'll need to have your own Debian repo which provides updates and dependencies for your app this is where open repos dotnet steps in I have been working with basil to get pure OS support added this will act as a unofficial community app store for the labor 5 giving developers a repo to upload packages and whatever dependencies they might need and exposing a simple-to-use store to install and update apps the same thing was done on the Nokia my mo tablets and phones and is being done on sailfish OS open repos does have existing clients but both are programmed in C++ and QT and may include UI elements which aren't open and need removed so I started work on community apps which is a simple gtk Python interface for open repos right now I'm the only thing in the store but I'm hoping that will change fast if the store did have apps this is what it would look like this is actually the sailfish OS apps but but it should be pretty close to what this will look like in the future the API calls do take a bit of time to return which is why the store is a bit slow a few things are missing from the app view page I want to add the gallery button and the comments button next the install button doesn't actually work at the moment due to a signing issue but basil is working on this I'm expecting that it will be fixed soonish I know it's rather simple looking but he'll it's the first verse and it's GPL so help us all out and send me a poll request big thanks to Basel for doing all the hard work here and thanks to the peers and devs who help troubleshoot the signature error P resume we'll need to focus on saving every drop of power and touching up the core phone functions the community is now receiving hardware and can do whatever the hell they want to thanks for watching bye

=== AI Linux Desktop | MAGI ===

hello and welcome today I want to introduce you to Magi it's this open- source desktop environment focused around AI for Linux it's all open source and available on my GitHub let's take a look in the D janga puzzle that is Linux this sits right on top of Marco and replaces the M panels for the most part this uses the M desktop environment tools to open an app you'll just click this top menu I haven't finished writing that bit so here's a placeholder type in the name of the app you want and just hit enter Bang bam if you notice at the bottom here it says ask anything about Kate if you select that it pops open a little menu that allows you to have an a chat with an llm you can just click this little microphone in order to ask it a question what is this app used for send it off and we get a reply everything from the whisper server to the language model is fully local and it is contact aware for contact awareness it passes in what app is selected or if you want something more precise you can select something with the mouse summarize the selection you can also hit this button to use ese at any point Untitled Kate appears to be a text editor of course this is a language model so you can just hit this microphone and ask it questions what's 5 Time 5 tell me a joke about Linux the most convenient thing about it is it's all just built in let's say you want to type into an application come down to this microphone and click and hold it while you talk this is a test to see if the voice transcription works and it does uh if you wanted to read it you simply just highlight it and then click this speaker icon this is a test to see if the voice transcription works not too Snappy as far as basic desktop elements you can switch desktops you have four of them by default but it is configurable um when you select applications it changes focus on what you're working on down here uh for the AI and the AI is context aware and can help you out with things like what are basic application or what have I selected and creating summaries it also has the voice uh transcription and um the ese built-in uh by default I plan on adding in even more AI features for now this is my desktop environment that I use on a daily basis so I expect to add in whatever is fun for me it's all open source it's available in my GitHub thanks for watching bye

=== Do Hardware Kill Switches Actually Work? ===

Hello and welcome. Today we're going to talk about hardware kill switches. They've been shipping on more and more alternative devices and they do things like cut power to various devices like the microphone, camera, Wi-Fi, or even the modem. The pitch is pretty straightforward. You flip the switch and you know on a physical level that the device is off. Like if you switch off the microphone, it's physically not listening. My phone lives in my pocket 90% of the time. So having a physical hardware kill switch that blocks the camera or the front camera is about as useful as my pocket. U very rarely am I walking my phone around pointing it at things that I don't want recorded. It begs the question, are these actually useful or just privacy theater? The argument goes that software can lie and therefore hardware is always more secure. When you tap disable microphone on Android, you're trusting there's no bug, back door, or vulnerability in the software stack. That's actually all a pretty fair point, but let's see if the FLX1S implementation is actually any good. Flipping the camera switch triggers a GPIO pin. The colonel sees it and stops the hardware abstraction layer. When off, the I squared C bus just fails. And the GPIO is input only, meaning you can't spoof this with software. When you're in the camera app and you flip the switch, you can see the feed drops instantly. You do have to restart the app in order to get the feed back. The modem switch has a similar pattern. GPIO triggers the kernel. Wireless gets killed. Input only pin can't be faked. But for the mic switch, this is actually a really good one. No GPIO events, no kernel logs, no ALSA changes. Nothing in software even knows it flipped. There's literally no software bypass for this. signal gets cut in the analog domain. Okay, now here's where things get interesting. None of these switches can disable the accelerometer. And can accelerometers be used to capture audio data? Yes, they can. So, here's the microphone kill switch, and I'm flipping it off. I'll go ahead and play some tones through the speaker and record the accelerometer data. Here's the basic tones I played. And here's what I was able to recover from the accelerometer. So yeah, that worked. Frequency stuff came through pretty clean. Let's go ahead and try some speech. This is the original audio clip. I'm going to go ahead and play. But private drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Derslley's front door. It crept into and here's what the accelerometer was able to capture. Not really intelligible. You can tell that there's a rhythm there, but the actual words are gone. So, what's going on? The FLX1S accelerometer has a max frequency of about 380 hertz. That's a hardware limit on this particular sensor and there's no way to bypass it, which should put you in about 190 hertz as far as maximum recoverable frequency. Here's what that normal speech sounds like if I reample at this 380 Hz. &gt;&gt; Nearly 10 years had &gt;&gt; not much there. Human speech needs much higher frequencies around 2500 hertz to be intelligible. So really in the end, this isn't a particular attack vector. The microphone switches off and you can be pretty sure that your phone's not recording audio. Let's say you're in a sensitive meeting and you flip off the network switch. Secure, right? Cuz no data out. Well, if your phone's infected with sophisticated malware, it can just wait. Record data when it has access to the microphone and send that data when it has access to the network. Airplane mode has the same limitations, by the way. It's not just a hardware kill switch thing. One thing that can happen pretty easily if you do use the hardware kill switches is you can forget what state they're in. The user interface doesn't always update or doesn't update quickly. For example, if you use the hardware kill switch for the microphone and forget to turn it on, you might take video that doesn't have audio, completely forgetting about that feature. So, here's where I land. This stuff is legit. It does work and it does protect you. I just don't have a particular need in my daily life for it to be useful. The accelerometer side channel does exist, but isn't really practical for any real attack. Potentially, you could use AI to reconstruct more of the voice, but you'd have to train individual AIs per speaker, and I don't think that's ever been tested at 380 Hz before. The cash and weight problem is definitely the biggest defeater of hardbo switches. If you're flipping them on and off constantly, you'll eventually forget to flip them off when you need a sensitive meeting blocked, and you'll have network connectivity eventually, still leaving room for softwarebased attacks. At the end of the day, I wish this wasn't the angle we were pushing. I understand that it's a good marketing angle and that it does attract a certain type of user base to these very niche devices, but I'd honestly rather see a HDMI port or a USB port, potentially even a full-sized Ethernet port. that would be much more useful for my daily life than a hardware kill switch. So yeah, these hardware kill switches will remain in their on state for probably the remainder of the phone life. But uh if you guys have an interesting use case for the hardware kill switches or if you think they're more valuable than I think they are, please leave a comment below. I'd love to have my mind changed on this. Thanks for watching. Bye. Sit on the side. Three flippity toggles of privacy pride. You flip and you flop and the mic goes to sleep. The camera goes dark. Not a pixel will peep. Them goes poof. No signal gets out. is through. But flip it again and it all comes right back. It's not a brick phone, just a privacy hack. &gt;&gt; But what's your use case? &gt;&gt; I can't find mine. &gt;&gt; What's your use case? &gt;&gt; The phone works just fine. &gt;&gt; Oh, tell me. Oh, do I got no use? &gt;&gt; So, how about you? Are you a journalist running from spies? A diplomat hiding from government eyes? An activist tweeting from some secret place? Well, those are some very legitimate cases. But me, I'm just me with my phone in my jeans. The camera points down and sees nothing but me. I tested the switches. They work. Yes, they do. But do I go flip them? I haven't a clue. &gt;&gt; So, what's your use case? &gt;&gt; The batteries fine. &gt;&gt; Come on, let me know. Just drop your case &gt;&gt; in the comments below. Just drop your use case. &gt;&gt; Now a use case is better than a used case. You see that's the squishy silicone thing. That joke was quite free and I gave it to you. You're welcome. You're welcome. Now back to the No flippity switchy floppity free. You bobby and two and three. &gt;&gt; The modem goes by, the camera goes fly. But that is just up. It does nothing. That's &gt;&gt; the mic is the best when it's pure AND IT'S TRUE. &gt;&gt; NO SOFTWARE CAN SPY. THERE'S NO DIGITAL. &gt;&gt; IT CUTS in the analog. Isn't that &gt;&gt; the CPU doesn't know what that switch even means? &gt;&gt; So what's your use case? &gt;&gt; WHAT'S YOUR USE CASE? &gt;&gt; I REALLY DO want to know. Help me solve this case. Drop a comment. Change my mind. Prove me wrong. And thank you for listening to this silly song. la me know.

=== Wow! A New Linux Phone! FLX1s ===

Hello and welcome back. The world finally has a true contender to Android and Apple. It's the FLX1S, a true Linux phone running a Debianbased distribution. Let's take a look. As you can see, the specs here are pretty impressive. It's got 8 gigs of RAM, 128 gigs of storage, and an impressive CPU. It also has hardware kill switches. That is super impressive. First thing since the Libram 5 that's had easily accessible switches on a device like this. The frequency support here looks pretty good for the United States and I plan to test this out on T-Mobile to see how it performs. Fury OS is the native operating system on this phone and it allows you to run native Debian apps as well as Android applications. This gives you the best of both worlds where you can easily utilize Android applications that you can't get away from but at the same time be able to use a Linux stack to develop whatever you want. Want to build a Python application? Fine. Want to develop in C++? Do it. Want to build your own programming language? This is the device for you. At least the device for you in 2025. It's still in pre-sales, but it's finishing it production run soon. So, if you want in on this first batch, I'd pre-order pretty soon. I plan to get my hands on one of these suckers and put it through its paces. Let's see if the world has a new Linux phone king. Thanks for watching. Bye. I walk through a graveyard of halfin dreams of pineones that stuttered and split at the seams. I flashed Ubuntu. I tried selfish OS and ended each day with a new set of woes. So, here's to the FLX1s. Our prayer in the night. May the Bluetooth connect and the batteries stay bright. We don't ask for magic. We don't ask for much. Just a good Linux phone that doesn't completely suck. Remember that camera that took 10 seconds to load? Then crash the whole system and enter safe mode. I just want to get texts from my friends. Is that strange without the whole user interface having to change? Oh, here's to the FLX1s. Our prayer in the night. May the apps not all crash with the greatest of might. We don't ask for magic. We don't ask for much. Just a slick Linux phone that doesn't totally suck. My wallet is open. My hope is on high. Please don't make me go back to that fruit in the sky. I'm tired of gardens with very high walls. I just want to answer my gosh darn call. So, thanks for watching. You understand the pain. Let's hope this one finally breaks the whole chain. Please don't suck.

=== Librem 5 | Android apps? ===

I came across an interesting post on the pier ISM user forum this user was able to run an Box from within the x86 64 VM build of POS Plus Vash for those that don't know and box is a way of running android applications from standard gönül innings it uses snap for isolation although security is still work-in-progress for an box arm 64 and of course the desire to run android applications on the dev kit is quite high even I would love to run my bank app and I'm sure others would love what's happened some other messaging clients I went ahead and started researching what it would take to run an box on a Libra 5 it looks like a lot of work to bring an Box to arm 64 is already done which is very good news and I was able to find a compiled version of and box for arm 64 so I tried installing snap unfortunately this gave me a squash FS error I went over to the matrix channel and complained to the devs and they have a pretty good idea what's going on they enabled squash FS XE in the kernel and all I had to do was update my dev kit and I was able to pull down this change the error message was completely different this time complaining about cgroups freezer I was able to find this crappy hack round which involved copying assists FS c groups from a running desktop and using mount - - r bind which did work but was quite ugly and clearly not the right solution DPA had a much better plan to fix this and also gave me updated kernel build directions so I built a colonel with config C group freezer enabled and installed it to the dev kit with working snaps I took a stab at installing the precompiled and box I did manage to build an box in an armed 64 emulator but it worked less well than the one I found here now that an box is installed all I needed to do is install the kernel modules unfortunately building the kernel modules failed it turns out this was because the kernel was built on my x86 64 computer which built some of the items as x86 so that they could be used to build the rest of the kernel I was able to rebuild the kernel scripts on the dev kit and the kernel modules did compile after that but they wouldn't load the only thing I could think to do was build the kernel on something arm 64 like the dev kit you that did seem to fix the issue I can now install the modules without issue and I can even access an Android show when I click on the icon I get this pretty interface but it does eventually air out saying session manager failed to become ready running the session manager from the serial connections seg faults when you run the session manager from within the GUI you can see it complains about the egl and some other graphic stuff if you leave this session manager running in this way and box still airs out with session manager failed to become ready that's all the progress I have been able to make so far on an Box at the very least snaps will soon work by default on the labrum 5 phone with the community soon to receive hardware I'm sure will have this up and running very soon just for fun I installed a few extra applications the usage app looks quite beautiful it gives you a CPU utilization graph as well as which applications are using RAM and the most processing power it also gives you a simple way to track down which folders are using up all your disk space very handy if you're running low on space the only critique I have is the CPU graph itself is quite CPU intensive as soon as you scroll down past that graph it drops considerably as far as total power to run the usage application not much has changed for the update GUI but they did add a cool reboot fade out effect also after the reboot I did get a notification tapping on it brought me to an update report very cool the disk utility app also looks very good on a small form-factor thanks for watching bye

=== Android and IOS Contender | Librem 5 ===

in today's duopoly we have Android and iOS in this ecosystem it is pretty easy for me to predict how your next phone experience is going to go you buy a new phone it's really fast and really pretty within a year and a half of installing updates the phone is slow and aggravating as hell to use the problem is phones have been really fast for years now and a phone with a octa-core processor running at 2.3 gigahertz has no business being slow so you might think what if I never install updates on my phone will it stay faster well yeah maybe but you also might hand your banking details over to Bob the hacker who stares at the CVE thread watching for vulnerabilities to get into your phone so not installing updates probably a bad pick is there any way to take control of your own phone well to some extent and depending on the phone you have you can install roms roms our user modified versions of Android that are usually much slimmer than the main branch of Android but still can suffer from some of the additional bloatware being put into mainline Android this makes installing Proms a good crutch but not a good solution so back to how a couple year old phone can still have an octa-core processor and four gigs of ram these things are computers they're just computers with really broken operating systems that don't have administrative rights it should be criminal to lock out root access from your own hardware where the hell is the right to modify what you buy do we even own our own phones think about who is selling you the devices or who is even making the os's for the devices Google is an ad company they want to know everything and anything about you and they want to know it frequently which means your phone will be sending location data application usage search terms all sorts of different statistics gathered from random places that are all googly all in the hopes of better providing targeted advertisement you gotta ask yourself is there a alternative to this self-deprecating targeted ad calculator well to create such a device it's gonna take a different type of company one who's not so much interested in money but fundamental rights and people fortunately such a company has existed for a while now peer ISM has been making freedom respecting hardware and software for years and is now working on the Liebherr 5 device which is a phone that runs proper Linux not no lockdown Android version of Linux but Linux that you have administrative access to a bootloader that you can write to instructions to build your own operating system even this is a truly open phone from the hardware to the software to your pocket they're not going to be selling advertisement data that they claimed from your GPS location they're not going to be sending software updates that make the phone's slower quite the contrary in fact as time goes on and the community builds more and more packages around the labrum 5 the device will in fact become more usable and as hardware support increases in fact faster to use more snappy more features it's literally the opposite of iOS or Android while this phone is set to release this year there is a ways to go development kits have already shipped and a large number of operating systems has already started being ported to the device including Ubuntu touch post-market OS and of course the default PR OS and I'll be honest I would be shocked if this is the only three options this just might be the first three options in a world where your phone is your computer and you have administrative right what does that even look like thanks for watching bye

=== Python | Codecademy walkthrough E01 ===

if you're interested in learning Python I'm gonna start from the first lesson on codecademy let's get started so if you want to teach a computer to talk you use the print statement no no no no if you want to tell the computer to print text you use the print statement and it's procedural and what I mean by that is if I do fish and I do read that it's going to start at the top of my file and print this and then it's going to print that so the output of this looks looks like this the fish and cat so I mean it's statement is print which is a function and that's why there are parentheses and it takes the argument whatever you want to say pretty swifty I think we all get this yeah print it's kind of like the statement but it's it's called a function and that's why there are these parentheses and then it takes the argument of a string that's why we have in quotes something if it's in quotes it's a string so we could also do print like one but I strongly recommend you don't do that because print supposed to take string arguments not integer arguments but it works it would be better though the typecast and say it is a string technically that's the clean way to do it but don't worry about that just yet this green they're trying to tell you that there's a difference between Python two and three and they're correct but the difference is really small and really not that noticeable except for the print statement back in the day if you were writing on Python 2 which I discourage at this point right on Python 3 but if you were to write on Python 2 you could do Lin high and that would run fine but these days if you were to try that it would barf out saying you forgot your parentheses so it's a function treat it like a function yeah yeah yeah and then and there there are definitely other differences in Python 2 &amp; 3 but especially starting out and you're not gonna notice any of them except for print next okay so we're going over strings in this screen which I kind of already did but let's go over it a little bit more that's that's a statement it's a function because it has these parentheses and in quotes as a string in Python it's totally valid to have a floating string like this you could just have that as a line it doesn't do anything but it's valid you can also combine strings with the plus symbol so hello plus space and let's do it let's go ahead and print this to run it so yeah you can do that and there are reasons you would want to add strings like this so you're gonna want to use this every time you use variables and you want to combine them together for example let's go over a little bit of variables so in Python you can store anything basically in a variable a variable looks like this test gets and then something input so now test will reference info what does that mean it means if I put tests right here it's the equivalent of me putting info right here so that line and that line are equally worthless to the program it's like here's a floating stream that does nothing here's another floating stream that does nothing print hello and then print this let's say you want to store something else you could store a integer like 1 or 2 or 7.3 which is now a float or a double because it's got a decimal it's no longer an integer or whatever whatever you really want here you can have a string of symbols you could name gets David then we'll do hello plus name this line is worthless on that that's the most common use case for the Plus setup the variable use it later in the program and let's move on okay so debugging is actually pretty important and python has pretty good error messages so let's go ahead and run this barfs this has actually happened to me maybe a couple thousand times it's complaining because this character and this character the start and stop string have to be the same so a valid way to do this would either be single quote and any single quote or start double quotes and double quote and the reason you'd want to do this is if you want to have a single quote inside of your text you can do it just like that or if you want to have double quotes inside your text you can do it just like that now if you want to have both you'll have to use an escape character which is the backslash basically that means treat the following character differently and then you can use the same single or double quote inside of your text now it's going to run this you can see the single quote is right there so yeah you can do either of those things next all right so let's do a bit more on variables named X a X 24 and then let's do print name David is I got the standard print statement which we're all accustomed to and the argument we're gonna give it is actually this and this is gonna be executed and turned into a single string before it's passed into print so this is the string logic for saying the name plus is plus the string Erised version of page plus years old now the reason you have to do the STR around this it's because it's an integer and you can't say here's this string plus here's this integer plus here's this string you have to say string plucks string plucks string or integer plus integer plus integer which is gonna be totally different maths for example two plus two is not four if it's a string but if it's an integer it comes out as four so typecasting is important let's say we have strings and want to treat them like integers we can just by wrapping them with the int just like we can wrap with a the STR if you want strings so int 2 plus and 2 is 4 or we can do the vice-versa where we have STR 2 plus STR of 2 is 22 that's that's typecasting and variables yeah we did better than this this one slide so let's go to next oh why did you pop up that's oh I actually have to do something create a very both calls today's date and assign a value that will represent today's date to that variable okay date and let's go to Linux for a second there's my console x here it is it's gotta say that huh Bay pissed wrong well seem to like that so moving off it's just an arbitrary string we could have put potato in there and it would have moved on but that's okay okay so this is kind of interesting it's going over how you can do addition here and store the result of Python 3 and we can do some subtraction on results and we can do multiplication store that we can do some division and store that we could do really long nasty looking things store that now interesting thing on the command line Python which is the real version if you were doing this on command line if you run a variable with no arguments it's going to print back what's in that variable it's very useful and it doesn't really do anything but here's what I mean if I if I just type in a variable name it's gonna spit that out you can store that into a new one just like that so now how do you move are there there's equal I can even do one gets new bar / that old one oh and what I did did just there is tab completion command-line does have tap completion of variable names and function names so I could do 1 we get 1 so yeah you can do that in their examples they're just storing results oh they're going over modulus module this is pretty cool I guess that means we got to go over integer division versus regular divisions so let's do that now it's where you divide something and you get a integer back but an integer doesn't have decimals so instead of returning 1.6 if you typecast it to an int it's going to concatenate set the right word no it's going to truncate your variable so if it's 1.9 it's still gonna be just 1 but if it's 2.1 it's gonna be to where's this 0.6 blah blah blah blah blah well it's you can find that with modulus kind of so oh don't do that if we do let's do their example 15 modulus 2 which will print 1 so you divide 15 by 2 you're gonna have a left over 1 because 15 is not divisible by 2 14 is divisible by 2 or any number and then the remainder is 0 so if you want remainders you use modulus and that's actually pretty useful in certain scenarios okay instructions multiply two numbers together and assign the result to a variable called product okay well copy product there gets how does it even know if I'm doing anything that it asks it says 1 times 2 or 3 is an acceptable like Bank look what's just does this work does this count I just try to be nice basically I have to do the second part too so it wants these numbers specifically because that's a lame program that's a cooler program Hey look there's actually data cool I'm bored and tired so let's do this another day fun though right

=== Librem 5 Screen Reader ===

back when i owned a samsung galaxy note edge i was really impressed with the optical character recognition built into the operating system simply pull out the stylus click the button and drag out a box samsung's version of android would then take a picture of that part of the screen and do optical character recognition on the image and pull out any recognizable text this was really handy for text everywhere including newly taken photos then one day after running software updates this feature was nowhere to be found in any case i set out to duplicate the optical character recognition feature for the leapfrom five since the lever 5 doesn't have a built-in stylus i went with a gesture based interface this part of the script listens for a three finger tab from the leaproom 5 screen when the app detects a trigger tap it prompts you with two options the most important part lets you draw out a box and run optical recognition on that part of the screen what this is actually doing is waiting for you to drag out a box then taking a screenshot and cropping it down to the selected part the cropped image is then fed into tesseract and then the output is put into the weyland clipboard or rather it reads the selected part of the screen the second main feature is the clipboard reader if you tap with three fingers then tap once calculator the script checks to see if anything is highlighted and reads that if nothing is highlighted it reads from the copy and paste buffer text to voice is done by selling out to google and playing the audio files that come back now that this app at least kind of works it can really come in handy if you're not sure how to pronounce a word or if you need to copy text out of an image because this uses optical recognition it's not always perfect at reading what's on screen but it allows you to copy from just about anywhere well except the middle of web pages clearly it was a bad idea to make the selection before taking the screenshot to give this some sort of ui pie game seemed like the lowest hanging fruit to display an image in a basic interface to drag out a selection this is mostly the same but with a bit of nice wrapping around it once this is opened it takes a screenshot then displays the screenshot for you to select out an area you can cancel and reselect or you can have it run the image to text part of the program at any time you can also have this app read what's in your clipboard by default it now uses e-speak but it can still use google voice if you configure it some the biggest issue is this program has no trigger now to fix this i strip down the original script to just a two finger tap detector sadly this didn't work as sometimes it ends up thinking that every tap is a two finger tap fortunately looking for a three finger tap seems to work a lot better this is what i ended up with for a detection script to kick off everything automatically this desktop file can be placed in the right place to start everything up after every reboot feel free to poke around or help out on this gpo3 project thanks for watching bye project name equals read it on touch generic name

=== Home Automation: Home Assistant, VOSK, and Python ===

i've always wanted a star trek like interface to my computer red alert there's just something really cool about barking orders at your computer just to have them executed all clear the way i went about setting up my smart home was with home assistant there's a bit more to learn than with the other hubs but nothing comes close to the flexibility and coolness you get with home assistant to get started i found it best to install an x86 computer you'll want to install the full os or the dot devs as this will allow you to install add-ons for the libre mini i went with a dab install as the full os requires a uefi bios after you have the base install of home assistant you can add your devices i'm still undecided which protocol standard is best but for now i'm using zigbee devices with a zigbee hub attached to my computer as for wi-fi devices connecting proprietary small computers to your home network that's controlled by software hardware and people outside your network is dumb especially if you have unsecured api calls bouncing around your home network all the time i've yet to test z-wave devices but i think it has the same licensing issues as zigbee all three of the common smart home standards suck and need free software badly if someone can point out a wi-fi smart device that uses open source software please let me know i think wi-fi will be the way forward just not this privacy nightmare that we have going on right now another issue with zigbee is it's kinda slow this is one of my wake up automations you can see each light change color and brightness i bet if these were wi-fi bulbs the change would be much more in sync with each other and much less one at a time just because wi-fi is faster the next part my home automation is the listening part i use a simple vosk script constantly listening for any words it can make out the script then uses curl to send these words to my core home program i'm calling home butler home butler is a flask program that takes these words and builds them into a sentence each time looking for a trigger phrase or word if a trigger word is found it runs the automation program for the trigger word to make a new voice automation you add a script with the trigger word as the name in the voice commands folder if the command needs multiple voice triggers you can add an underscore between the voice commands the scripts themselves can import a few really handy functions if they need it this makes it really simple to call a home assistant command just look up the device entity id and find the json data you want to send you will need to set up your api key in settings.pi the api key can be found here in home assistant this means home assistant connects to all the devices vosk listens for words and sends them to home butler home butler executes scripts when trigger words are spotted i've also added basic api triggers for making it easy to call scripts from home assistant this is handy if you need to trigger an automation in-home butler from home assistant to add a new api call you'll want to install this file editor plugin then edit the config file with a new command to call your home butler url ending with the script you want to run then you just need to add a script with that name in the api folder while my food replicator is still an early prototype this model can already print nice looking inedible items the store sensor can tell when i close the door which triggers a home assistant automation that calls a url running on home butler which then sends a command to my octoprint server to reprint the last print in case you want to push a button instead of talking i started work on a web interface for home butler it's early days but i want to make this look somewhat star trekky like always my code is gpl and can be found below thanks for watching bye

=== Robot and Librem 5 Hacking ===

screen-capture keyboard input and a hacky way to install stuff stick around to the end to hear about the robot I'm working on out of the box the Liebherr 5 has an on-screen keyboard that looks and feels good you do have the option to switch out the default for some alternatives at the moment this is the only alternative that I know about the default is a bit better-looking Bluetooth is also a good option to connect a keyboard using this mini keyboard mouse thing I'm able to enter text in x11 windows as well as native Weiland windows now simpler also fills home on the labrum five you let's see how many firefox tabs five can open okay not bad something that really took me by surprise is when I press the key combo ctrl alt f1 on a desktop computer I would expect that to take you to the first virtual terminal and that's precisely what the Libra 5 did after I was done poking around ctrl alt f7 takes you back to the GUI session also just like a normal Enix computer if you want to use your desktop keyboard a USB hub will be supported at some point but it's not working just yet you can however use a program called X 2x which by default will allow you to use your Linux computer mouse and keyboard on any x11 app running on the libra 5 I wrote this small hack around script that allows x2x to work with the native Weiland windows it does need a bug fix for x11 windows though but it does work pretty well for most use cases after messing around with a few screen capture tools I managed to find one that works on the labrum 5 it takes a few minutes to setup but once it's done you can record video natively on the labor 5 you can see it does drop a few frames when the workload is high but it does get the point across nicely community apps have seen an update it now allows you to install flat hub packages that are listed on this wiki it's not hard to create apps for the Leoben five and it's not hard to get on this wiki you just need to post at this user forum pointing everyone at your code it's also a good idea to package is flat pack or Deb I prefer packaging is Deb but flat pack is well-documented and much more popular at the moment I should also mention the key that open repos uses is too old for POS because of this I force app to ignore the bad key and install anyway this is fine for the initial installation but it breaks updating from the software store the simplest solution is to remove the offending package before you run updates I'm also working on a free and open-source cat toy it's a robot I'm building with my roommate the goal here is to entertain cats and dogs or whatever is willing to chase a laser the robot is built from a few parts an x86 powerhouse is used for image processing it pulls its images from a USB webcam this is where things get interesting the x86 machine is also attached to a Raspberry Pi over a serial USB connection when the Raspberry Pi starts up it otto runs a program called laser control module or LCM for short its job is to listen for commands over serial and manage two servo motors the servo motors take PWM frequencies as input in turn the servos move to an angle based on the frequency which is why I have a pre-configured Max and min PWM value more or less and the harder might pop off a servo the hardware limits are further restraint to things only in frame by the x86 machine here are some example commands that the controller takes it's how much we want to change the PWM frequency for X&amp;Y it also has a value for how bright the laser is but this isn't hooked up in hardware yet this is the command the x86 computer uses to limit the hardware restraints to things only in camera the main program running on the x86 machine has three main threads this thread is spun off to update the video this thread updates a laser position based on an AI routine and the main loop is processing the video into something the AI function can understand the AI is very simple and needs a bit of work the pink dot is where the software thinks the laser is the green dot indicates the center of movement I had it configured to use the mouse location as extra input for the laser this was a lot of fun to play with but for some reason this line of code leaked memory like mad so I ended up disabling mouse input and added arrow keys to move the laser around I didn't account for the dog's tail wagging so much it is definitely throwing off the center of movement I might have to toss that idea or maybe taking longer average I know this content is a bit different than my norm but everything I made here is free software and can be found in my bit bucket thanks for watching bye

=== Neural Network Meets Falling Sand Game ===

hi everyone today I'm excited to share the progress of a Falling Sand game powered by neural Nets let's dive into the evolution of this project and the fasinating challenges I've encountered along the way my journey begins with an ambitious idea inspired by a paper about using stable diffusion to run Doom intrigued I thought I might be able to do something similar but scaled down with my RTX 3090 after trying stable diffusion for myself the results were interesting while I'm sure you could Coke something meaningful out of this approach doing so with 24 gigs of vram proved to be quite the challenge undeterred I decided to Pivot and use a more tailored approach enter our first convolutional neural network model B this model uses convolutional layers with batch normalization it takes in seven channels one for each element and outputs predictions for the next state of each cell this version showed great promise it had a basic set of elements sand water plant wood acid and fire and acted somewhat realistically however it did have its quirks liquids were a bit chunky shall we say with a working proof of concept I decided to up the ante enter the improved sand model this model introduces several improvements increased input channels to 14 as we added more element types used a larger initial kernel size of 5x5 to capture more context implemented a bottleneck architecture expanding and then Contracting the number of channels the results we hit a smooth 60 frames per second and saw improved interaction between elements however we Face some challenges with time dependent phenomenon like fire fading over time there's also this strange waterfall effect that's been happening where the bottom part of your drawings fall faster than the top part sometimes less is more and our next iteration simple sand model took that to heart this only uses three convolutional layers keep a consistent hidden size throughout removes batch normalization layers but the big kicker is it only uses the training set data that has the highest movement and wow did that deliver we're still getting our 60 frames per second and we're seeing much improved Behavior with temporal elements like fire fire now Fades naturally over time creating a much more realistic effect overall this version feels much more natural and responsive capturing the dynamic nature of our Falling Sand world but we still have the waterfalling issue and some elements don't work right looking into the future I'm excited to try out curriculum learning the plan is to gather data for each element individually then in pairs and then finally all together we'll also use three frames to try to give the model more time context during training we'll start with the simple scenarios and work our way up it's a work in progress but I have high hopes for this version the most exciting takeaway for this journey is that we've basically created an accelerator for a Falling Sand game traditional versions of the Falling Sand game tend to slow slow down the more elements and more interactions that are on screen but the AI version doesn't have this drawback you can have a full or empty screen with as many interactions as you want and it will run at the same frame rate all the source code for each of these versions is available on my GitHub feel free to play with each versions or mess around with the model architecture thanks for watching bye

=== Linux Phone That Actually Works ===

Hello and welcome. Today we're looking at the FLX1S by Fury Labs. It's one of those rare Linux devices that's actually good at being a phone. Let's take a look. All right, here's what you get in the box. The phone, some cute stickers. I also ordered the glass screen protector and a case. As a nice surprise, they also included a free pair of USBC headphones. I appreciate that since there's no headphone jack on the phone. Quick note on the screen protector, though. It's glass. Mine cracked in shipping, and I'd love to see a film screen protector instead. Let me save you some confusion. On day one, I thought this was the power button, and these were maybe programmable buttons. And then over here, I figured this was a volume rocker. And then you have your hardware kill switches. That's not the case. It's actually um this is a programmable button. These are your volume keys up and down. And then on this side, you have one very large uh power button right above your hardware kill switches. Not what I expected, but there you go. The hardware kill switches feel really good to use. They cover the microphone, camera, and modem and GPS. The UI needs a bit of work around these as it shows stale data when you flip them off and then shows them reconnect when you flip them back on. Okay, now the important part. Does it actually work as a phone? Here's where the FLX1S really shines. You can get calls and text just by putting in a SIM card and booting the device. Pretty slick. And as far as I can tell, they're pretty reliable. Mobile data had a bit of a hiccup where I had to toggle it off and then back on before I could actually use it. That's pretty basic troubleshooting that I feel like most users would be able to handle. and I bet would be covered by a simple reboot as well. I did enable the SUPPL server settings and took it for a drive and I could watch my icon move as I drove around in Gnome Maps, but a GPS that can actually get a signal is only half the battle. Right now, it uses Gnome Maps by default, which is no competitor to Google Maps. It'll do basic mapping and show you where you are, but if you need turnbyturn navigation, this ain't doing it. That's not really an issue with the FLX1S in particular. It's more of an issue with the mobile Linux ecosystem having a massive gap for mapping. Camera works. &gt;&gt; It can take photos. It can record video. &gt;&gt; Very goody duty. The shutter is a bit slow and I'd say the quality is maybe not on par with a standard Android phone, but certainly usable for basic things like um here's the cable layout I need to duplicate later. The app store is Gnome software which means it's a bit slow. It also seems it's configured with flatp pack by default. This is great for availability, but rough on a phone. This eats up space, memory, and bandwidth. Installing Gnome Secrets took about 3 minutes pulling down all the different run times. Okay, now for the real issue. A lot of these apps were never tested on this device, let alone mobile Linux in general. So, it's a bit of a mixed bag of what works, and it takes a bit of trial and error. Persistent people will find cool nuggets and cool apps. If you want every app to function, this is not going to be it. Now, on the Android side, this is where the FLX1S gets interesting. You can enable Andromeda, their Android compatibility layer, and install apps from Froid. But there's a catch. These apps you can't live without, banking apps, payment apps, often reject what looks like a rooted device. So, can you daily drive this? I think yes, but with some caveats. Phone calls, SMS, working web browsing, battery life, even Bluetooth is pretty solid. The major things that need work, I'd say, are camera quality and the lack of being able to run certain Android apps. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. Here's where things get really interesting. You can install cloud code directly on the device. That's pretty freaking nuts. As a dev box, this is miles ahead of Android and iOS. Full terminal access, the ability to modify software at any layer you want, build compositors, mess with the shell. I think the FLX1S is a pragmatic middle ground between what Linux phones could be with native support and what Android drivers allow. You have to deal with a lot of compatibility layers if you're going to dig deep on the software stack, but I think it's worth it as you get a pretty fast device to play with. So, who exactly is this device for? Someone who doesn't need a bunch of apps sucking them in or people who want to tinker and turn it into something truly epic. It's a phone that takes calls. It can do a lot more, but it's proportional to the effort you put in. If you want hardware kill switches and real privacy, this has them. If you're comfortable troubleshooting, you'll do just fine. I'd probably wait if you need a flawless camera or if banking apps are non-negotiable. The community around Fury Labs is actually very friendly. That's one of the better things that they've managed to create. As a teaser, this is the Flick shell running on the FLX1S. It's definitely in prototype stages still, but man, you can make this thing look quite bitching. Subscribe for mobile Linux updates and future projects I'm working on. Can you say bye-bye? &gt;&gt; Bye. Could build a server in my hand. Code an app while I'm waiting in line. SSH and anything or just call my mom. That's fine. Possibilities are endless. But I don't have to prove it. It's just a phone if you want it. Just a phone, nothing more. Or dig deeper and you'll find it. Opens every single door. Make it simple, make it crazy. It's whatever you decide. Just a phone  or a whole computer. Either way, I'm satisfied. No apps begging for attention. No algorithm  in my brain. Send a text, make a call. Sometimes simple breaks the chain. It's just a phone  if you want it. Just a phone, nothing more. Or dig deeper and you'll find it opens every single door. Make it simple. Make it crazy. It's whatever you decide. Just a phone or a whole computer. Either  way, I'm satisfied. I just for our everything. You're a call. You're call your call. Our call.

=== Booting and Using Old Hardware ===

one of my growing passions is old computer hardware getting linux running on a 386 and unix running on something older than that are my ultimate goals at the moment sadly my 386 board that boots has a real potato for a bios it won't boot anything i've tried so far earning it this place of shame on the wall i'm also building this monster i got this sucker to power on just once right after this picture was taken i reset to factory settings i don't know why i did this as the board was likely already as reset as it needed to be by being powered off for countless years this is the screen i'm stuck at now i've tried to replace all the crazy old ram and i've even tried different arrangements of ram but without any luck i have a feeling that i've nuked this bios and it will need to be reflashed trouble is i don't have a chip flasher and even if i did i don't know if i could find a bios for this really old board my 286 luggable has a decent bios for its age the most i've managed to get this to do is to print e repetitively until i powered down the system this is when i attempted to boot a copy of xenix looking up in the manual this means error booting not super helpful i do plan to test out a bunch of other os's and to retry a few os's over a 5.2 inch floppy drive just to see if that helps booting anything i also have a number of old motherboards this one powers on and has a bunch of built-in ethernet cool i've also picked up a few of these guys so far no signs of life any advice on getting os's running on these old computers is welcome this beauty is my favorite at the moment it has a 100 megahertz pentium processor the bios seems to like booting floppies and even that is pretty picky the best way i've found to boot this machine is with this really epic boot floppy this floppy boots and lets you select a number of tools one of which allows you to start up cds very handy the best os i have found so far is called basic linux it takes just two floppies to boot and install the first image gets dd directly to the floppy this is a really sensitive process make sure to let the floppy indication light turn off after you've run and see the sync command return if even a bit is out of place this won't boot the other file is a bit more challenging to write in my opinion you need to format a floppy by running this command i find it kind of odd that you don't have to put down a partition table first then mount the floppy and copy over the compressed archive with the install media made booting the first disk starts up lilo and eventually asks for the second flopping once fully booted you'll have access to a fully featured shell this os has no issue seeing my hard drive which means i can install it the process to install is more or less use fdisk to lay down a partition table and add at least one partition next format with an ext2 file system and mount it under hd he will ask you to swap to floppy disk 1 after it's completed copying disk 2. with that done we can reboot to our new install of basic linux i've tested two different network cards one isa and the other pci and neither of them show up but getting this computer online is really not needed for its primary purpose using this computer i can take a 1.2 megabyte floppy image held on a bigger 1.44 megabyte floppy i did that directly to the 5.2 inch floppy drive yeah i think she's dead it's not a super elegant solution to writing old floppy disks but it opens up a bunch more testing i can do with my 286 which might not be able to boot from these newer floppies using a boot floppy you can also boot the latest version of dsl linux on this computer i can't get this to install but it's a much more advanced gui than basic linux basic linux also ships with a gui it's really just a way of running commands but i like it surplus gizmos is just too close to where i live i could not help but pick up this oddity this old spaceball is a serial mouse not exactly common in 2021 but actually not super hard to make work in linux simply plug it into a serial to usb and run this command this will make the spaceball show up as a joystick using a tool like huge joypad you can program its behavior this is actually pretty cool you can twist the ball in any direction you can push the ball in any direction and you can pull up and down on it i can't say i'm switching anytime soon but i could see how this would be fun for some games thanks for watching bye

=== New Linux Phone DE | Flick V0 ===

Okay, quick demo of the Flick shell I've been working on. You can use a pattern or a PIN, and you can always fall back to your systems password. Here's the settings app as it is. Now, you can toggle things like the touch effect. The core idea of the shell here is that there are categories and you can select a default for each category. For example, the browser. You can long press on it and select which browser you want to open. When you click the browser, a swipe down from the top edge closes an application. Swipe from the right edge goes to the open app drawer. A swipe up goes back to the home grid. A swipe from the bottom edge just a little bit will open the keyboard. A swipe all the way from the bottom edge to the top will minimize the application and bring you back to the home grid. You can also swipe from the left edge to get to a quick settings. Let's demo it on the phone. This is a Pine phone, so excuse the insanely bad frame rates. That's pretty much the basic workflow. The keyboard is built into the compositor layer as well as all of the swiping. The shell and compositor share the same code base, so it's very unified. Anyway, thanks for watching. Bye. phones have tried for years down through blood and tears. A fully on a tiny screen, but what we need is something. Swipe up, swipe down, swipe left, swipe right. The N9 had it, they got it right. It's early days, a mountain to climb. The flick's going to get there one commit at a time. going to get there at a time. FPS. Watching Windows move is quite the test. Is that an app or a sideshow friend? I fell asleep before the  anim. Swipe up, SWIPE DOWN, SWIPE LEFT, SWIPE RIGHT. Something  tailored, something light. No more chain squeezed into a bone. Flick's building is something of its own. But hey now, hold up. Don't get too hype. This code is fresh. It's not yet ripe. Don't test it yet. I'm warning you. Wait till I talk food on my X1. When I can daily drive without the pain, then maybe maybe you can try this thing. Until then, thanks for watching.

=== UEFI Real Quick ===

UEFI is not scary it's not difficult it's not that hard let's go over it so you can actually start using it I'm gonna install Lubuntu this VM is being forced to boot via UEFI we're going to will detect if you start the installer with UEFI and fortunately you can automatically install for you but let's say you have another computer's operating system on there and you want to actually understand how to partition UEFI yourself it's not hard I'm gonna go ahead and manually partition this just so you can see exactly how it's done new politician table okay so the first thing you want the very first partition is the EFI boot partition we want to find efi system and what that will do is it will format it with fat32 and it will also make it have a mount point of slash boots slash efi on a lot of different distros and make it about half a gig now I'm gonna add my root partition I want it to be I want to leave about a gig so I can have some swap space and then swap space and that's a really basic efi partition scheme you got your boot route and swap now there are actual reasons to set up efi and not be lazy yeah it is an extra partition but you gain the ability to use GPT partition tables that's cool because now you can use disks that are larger than 2 terabytes as well as set up more than 4 primary partitions very useful if you want to have a crapload of operating systems on a single drive plus I hear they're adding more features to UEFI and they'll be more recent than the future to use it so might as well learn it now thanks for watching

=== Debugging Debian Based Distros ===

when i worked at novell in the early 2010s we used this nifty tool called support config to gather up system logs for debugging its counterpart was called sca which ran patterns against these system logs to look for known issues it then creates a nice looking html report all credit for these ideas go to my once mentor from my novel days jason record here's what the reports looked like back in the day support config plus these reports created a straightforward way for us in soos technical support to know the basic health of a server if we needed any logs or we had no idea where to start asking customers for a support config would make them feel heard and almost always give us some hint of what to try next in many cases the end report would link to a rewarded version of the customer's issue for example someone might call in saying that their network is down where in the report you might see an error about dns not resolving now that my day job is at purism i want to see these tools in the hands of power users and hopefully once matured a bit in use to help debug pure os or any other debian based device when it came to porting support config to debian i had a really hard time locating the source when i eventually did find support config source it was written in about 4 000 lines of bash code and collects way too much customer data with a bit of python i wrote a simple replacement for support config called the bug logs while not as advanced as support config yet this has one feature at its heart the support config largely ignores debug logs removes personal data from its logs by default if it does capture unwanted data it's a bug that should be filed and a filter created this user protecting feature goes back to the core ideal of how purism handles user data the other needed parts were also made available by jason record this included many patterns the core libraries used to analyze the configs and one of my very first python projects sca tool sca tool does what sca server does but locally it runs patterns against the support config and pops out an html report now that we can generate pretty much a support config on debian based distros it's time to get the pattern's core library up and running this library lets patterns pull sections as text or compare version strings to find which is newer the biggest issue with the python library is it's written in python 2 with some questionable variable handling after a lot of search and replace and a bit of editing i managed to get this partially working i also added a new function to replace the old way of pulling section text this is just much cleaner i'm not sure how many of the python patterns from the seuss side can be pulled over but if they're applicable only small changes would be needed while i've only worked on the python part of this the pattern's core library is written in a few languages and would only need a few small changes to be useful on debian based distros to get things going i started with a few basic patterns scripts in the local directory get applied to all systems while patterns in byzantium only apply to debian 10 based systems this is what a pattern looks like pretty much all patterns are based on one another so they all inherit the gpl2 license at the top we import core which knows how to deal with an extracted support config directory next we set up info about the pattern like what os this is for and any links that might be helpful next this info is used to initialize the pattern next is almost always the function that does the heavy lifting in this example we're reading hardware.text and getting the output of df-h slash we store that in a variable like you should then look through it line by line while sca is already open source i already understand the inner workings of so that seemed like a good place to start i gave it a quick python 3 update and patched it to work with the new debug log archives debug tool can now run patterns on already run archives or generate new archives and create reports on that i haven't tested all the command line options but i'm sure they could be made to work with just a few line changes i've always enjoyed the process of debugging an issue comes up that is certainly solvable with a bit of this or that debugging a component or problem is quickly found with this fancy workflow once an issue is identified an article and pattern can be written with that done the next time the problem comes up it will likely be identified and solved faster wanna help out i bet you'll love the gpl license and the handy links below

=== How to Kill Processes in Linux ===

hello and welcome back everybody I'm gonna give you a quick rundown on how to kill those pesky processes that just don't want to die so for example let's have Kate here's just a simple text editor and it closes fancy-dancy but let's go ahead and stop Kate with ctrl Z okay so longer working properly it's pretty much frozen there's a couple ways we can try killing this process way one is kill all kill all and the process name that'll kill all instances of Kate I only have one so that would be a valid way to do it now notice Kate's not dead what do you do if kill all has failed well you can pass in a signal to kill and kill all - 9 is the most nasty signal you can pass in if - 9 doesn't work you're better off rebooting than trying to continue to kill the process but we'll go ahead and kill - 9 that and you can see that it did kill the process and you you know notice when I hit enter my job control tells me you done killed Kate another way to do this is with just plain old kill will do the same thing freeze Kate but this time we're gonna find the pig probably the easiest way to find the pig is with top um if you've got a if you're trying to find something that uses a lot of CPU definitely tops the easiest way but for us Kate's not taking very much CPU so PS will do what we want so PSU ax is what I always pass in I grep so this is printing out a process table and we're piping that process table into grep and we're gonna search for whatever so in this case Kate obviously both of these lines are irrelevant the one we're looking for is this top one it's almost always gonna be the top one so this is our pit we can now type in kill and that pit and this is the same thing as kill all at this point and look it did the same thing and we can also because it didn't work passed in a - 9 and we get we done killed it all right and another useful way to kill a process especially a graphical process is with ex kill so we'll go ahead and do the same thing put him in the background but this time we're gonna actually make him run and we'll just pretend he's broken it was Kate broken we're gonna go to the a console make sure you can still see Kate when you run this command and type in X kill you'll notice your cursor changes to a little crossbones careful what you click on anyway click on your broken application and it will kill it that's the last way I'm going to show you how to kill process thanks for watching you

=== Poodillion (An OS game) ===

i spent the last few weekends mixing two of my favorite things rpg games and the command line while some games have a limited command line this game has a built-in operating system and bash as its interface i would split it first if i wanted ascii art or 2d graphics but i settled on 2d graphics using pie game for now this is the game poodlion this game is named after my dog whose nickname falls apart at the fact that she's not a poodle directories in the pajillion file system show up as rooms like bob says you can use cd to switch which room you're in every npc has a life file in the game's present working directory you can use the rm command to shoot lasers at most npcs simply by attacking their wi-fi killing this enemy has unlocked a door you can move the player around by tapping the screen or you can set a course with the arrow keys the first level takes place in depths deeper once you find your way over the directories in this room are procedurally generated try not to get lost as you find your way to the boss fight much of the player's statistics are controlled in the player's sis directory while the user has limited access to the sys folder the commands the player uses can manipulate the sys files this lets the commands edit the player's health power or even leave on-screen messages in-game once you defeat the first level you'll have a new command to play around with any file you touch starting with frog will become an npc with the life file you just created do note that this takes player power to spawn in when you first run the game it builds a chew root of debian 11 and copies in all the game files this way you don't have to worry about deleting the wrong files or having your personal data get in the way if this sounds like a fun game give it a download and test it out this is gpl3 and should work on most gnu linux desktops or phones thanks for watching bye

=== Next Gen Linux Phones ===

it's no secret that the libram 5 and pine Fones have been the best hardware to run mobile Linux on for the last few years but that's quickly changing let's take a look at what new devices are coming down the pipeline to kick things off let's start with things you can already buy Fury Labs has the flx1 which is an Android handset that's been reshaped into a Linux device this uses helium to bridge the driver Gap but that also means that you're stuck running Android kernels which will in turn limit the overall lifespan this device is capable of even stuck on a single kernel this could last a very long time given the proper software support its specs are no joke running 6 gigs of RAM 128 gigs of storage and a uh octe processor okay now for the big caveat of this device if you're in the United States it probably won't have the best cell reception while not exactly a phone the U console from clock work is a mobile Linux device that can have a modem so in theory you could turn this into a mobile Linux device albe it a chunky one this puppy is powered by a Raspberry Pi compute module so you have an option for what CPU and RAM you want to install with this kind of modularity it is possible that later down the road you could upgrade the compute module with something even better pretty cool the next few phones we're going to talk about are pre- crowdfunding so keep in mind that these may never come to fruition although although I hope they do the lick next is a true successor to the libram 5 it Sports a very similar look and feel including Hardware kill switches but the specs are completely Next Generation this baby has an octacore processor 32 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of onboard storage awesome very similar to the libram 5 this will be using a Debian based distribution and running the fos user interface this company seems to be taking open source and Hardware design seriously I truly wish these guys success in their crowdfunding Venture the Mecha Comet takes a leaf out of the libram 5's Playbook and uses an nxp processor in this guy it's a 1.8 GHz processor which should be a nice stepped upgrade to the libram 5 what makes this guy truly interesting is the full-size USB as well as the modular front connection with this device you can have a dedicated controller thumb keyboard or even build a robot keep keep in mind though this device will not be thin especially with its attachments while this would be a nice upgrade to the libram 5 it wouldn't be a dramatic Improvement like the next saish OS by Yola is one of the best mobile Linux distributions to date you can run it on a variety of Sony devices if you're willing to flash it yourself under the hood it's very similar to what Fury Labs is doing but instead of with a Debian based distribution with a RPM libzip based distribution while not not fully open source it's still a really good alternative so where does that put us I predict that in 2025 some company will outdo purism in mobile phone contributions it should be really interesting to see which company treats the developers the best and provides the most support for the longest I personally can't wait to see where the next and comment go and I'll get my hands on the hardware as soon as I can to put them through their Paces thanks for watching bye

=== Librem 5 | In Less Than a Year ===

it is not easy to build a smartphone it is even harder if you plan to ditch iOS and Android altogether in fact it has been tried and failed a number of times so much is needed in order to create a successful project of this type you need hardware software and just as importantly a community of dedicated developers peer ISM is just now solving the hardware problem by releasing the labrum 5 a crowd of hungry Linux developers and enthusiasts eagerly await this device and the software has direction and the solid base of Debian we know what we want we know what it will run on and we have a growing community to do it the importance of software direction cannot be understated this is a genome stack running on a standard display protocol it focuses on convergence and security this is in stark contrast with what lubuntu toj tried to pull off they wanted to reinvent a new display protocol called mirror they also focused on unity as the base GUI at the end of the day the Libre 5 advances the mobile Linux story while a bone to touch mostly advanced deprecated a boon to software however time will tell if Obi ports can rise from the ashes having dedicated in-house hardware is a huge advantage Pearson has chosen every chip that will go into the labrum 5 which gives them an edge for driver support and it would seem that peer ISM is dedicated to improve and upstream the hardware drivers this means that other distributions that want to use the Libre 5 hardware can take advantage of a lot of the hard work that peer ISM is doing replacing a mature platform like iOS and Android does not happen overnight much still needs done first but the progress has been incredible to follow in this perfect storm of hardware direction and a growing community let's see what peers and managed to pull off this year so far from horrifyingly ugly to pretty ok to completely standard the keyboard has seen a lot of revisions when I first got a test out the keyboard it was this ugly white disaster thing but as a positive it did have a way to press control-c escape and those other terminal friendly keys then later we had a much nicer themed version of this keyboard no usability changes just a nicer look and feel this keyboard was eventually replaced and now we have something that looks quite standard the alignment is much improved and feels way more on par with a standard smartphone experience the only downside is the terminal inputs are not there so no arrow keys ctrl C or tab I'm guessing at some point will have a way to switch between these two different keyboards so that we'll be able to interface with GUI applications and terminal applications just fine the web browser is one of the fastest moving pieces of software improvements and changes are common after every update or reflash one of the biggest changes is the improved rendering on the small screen originally a lot of the web pages had content cut off this has been very much improved where now every web site I've tested looks very good in the mobile form factor another big change is the performance which continues to improve day by day the UI has also seen some love it is very touch friendly and you can also make web app shortcuts the app drawer has also seen some incremental changes originally the app drawer did not have X's to close out applications and originally it didn't display all of the dot desktop files only displaying a couple pre installed applications now it displays all regular desktop files like you would expect any menu to and of course the performance is miles better than it used to be here we can take a look at the almost default gnome settings even with this odd form factor you can see much of the content is still cut off on the right this is true on most if not all of the screens somewhere around July I was able to test on the dev kit and they had fixed a lot of the display issues it was still pretty common though to get stuck with some unadapted screen requiring like escape on the keyboard or some touch input that's rendered off screen as of just about a week ago just about everything is working fine you there are still a few small UI bugs but they aren't out breaking like they used to be they have also added a cellular category but I won't be able to play with this much until I have a Libra 5 with a working base band a lot of small yet critical bugs have also been fixed rotating the display with the keyboard open used to force you to have to reboot the device due to the keyboard being in full screen with none of the other UI elements being present this is no longer the case the file selection dialog used to be completely unusable Pearson has done a great job porting this and it does look right now the scrolling framerate went from well this to a bit more manageable speed I expect the overall smoothness of this device to be considerably improved over the lifetime of the Libra 5 stability has also improved quite a lot when I first got the dev kit it was common for the UI to lock up or the phone to completely power cycle I have seen the keyboard get messed up a random cursor appear out of nowhere and of course that weird keyboard bug while it does still crash from time to time I can now develop for hours without a crash this is a big difference compared to how it used to be where it would crash at least every hour it still has a way to go but this is a great start I also made a bit of progress on ad box after copying and hacking a few libraries into place we can now see that it complains about matching Gio lacks visuals not really sure what that means but hey it's progress all that in less than a year which puts to shame the glacier like progress of something like the Gemini PDA I for one cannot wait to contribute to the next modern smartphone experience thanks for watching bye

=== fractals + deepdream.. Still training ===

hello and welcome back everybody so I know it's been a few days since I've made a video but my computer's still being utilized I'm training a neural net a deep dream on fractals once that's done I should have some pretty interesting output of deep dream mask fractals we'll see what happens until it's done standby you

=== Librem5 | Plasma Mobile ===

in March 2018 peer ISM announced the initial support for plasma mobile on their Libre m-- imx6 test boards the predecessor to the dev kit as many of you know the Libra 5 will work with two options for your desktop environment you have the genome based phone shell or Fache for short and plasma mobile if you're feeling crazy and want to run your desktop UI on your phone it's not difficult and you can see my last video on what it looks like today and of course whatever the community decides is important we'll also get ported to this device here is what plasma mobile used to look like running on the imx6 test board first off the icons are rather small and the graphics are kind of jittery and slow however the biggest issue is the cursor is outright missing this is forcing the developer to hold ctrl and super which draws that little rotating circle around the missing Mouse kind of a funny hack workaround that is no longer needed here is the built-in chess application it seems to work fine hmm but a little bit slow now that we've seen it run on the old iMac 6 test board let's go ahead and put the latest image on the dev kit and see what improvements have been made step 2 we need to resize the root filesystem a little bit of repo magic modify a couple system files and reboot thank goodness they had good documentation the first thing that strikes me is the icons are now too large and overlap slightly I'd still argue that's better than too small the KDE calendar app does seem to work just fine but the color scheme does kind of make it hard to see and washed out on the recording so my apologies the built-in chess app works so much better on this latest build just as a direct comparison you can see how many frames there are before and how many frames are now it is noticeably smoother as you move the characters around the board you can slide from the bottom of the screen or hit the left-hand squared to bring up after from here you can close or select which application you want in focus they also have the classic KDE widgets that you can add and this just gets put right in the space above your app drawer clock widget works great not really doing much but being there the system tray widget works fine as well showing off available disk space and presumably showing off other notifications as well like most standard smartphones a slide from the top will bring up the notifications and quick system settings you can get a pretty good idea of what this is gonna be like to use on a daily basis you can easily turn off your wireless you can modify your sound your location or if you just need a quick flashlight the notifications area does work here's a crash report and I'm assuming things like text messages and voicemails and things of that nature will also end up in the notification area the file manager is not optimized the icons are teeny and very tiny alright great so if you're looking forward to using KDE plasma mobile it's looking pretty promising there have been some pretty large improvements specifically to the graphic stack let's talk about gaming while purism has said they will be working on the basic features of the device like calling and texting in the base browser they have not said they were gonna be working on any games at all for the device so I've decided to test three different open-source games and see where they are at the moment with no human effort to make them actually run on the dev kit I installed mine test a minecraft clone T worlds and super tux cart starting with mine test it installs just fine but the icon doesn't show up in Fache running it from command line and Fache doesn't work either in yielding just a black screen but if you run it in KDE plasma mobile tada it runs just fine ish kind of I'm amazed at this point that I've never figured out how to open a keyboard in KDE plasma mobile if somebody knows how to open a keyboard let me know cuz this was kind of a big issue as I'm not sure how to open the on-screen keyboard I used X due tool in order to input a world name but after inputting a world name I was able to click create world and see a wonderful green bar load up it didn't do anything past that unless you count crashing the entire device as something T worlds does seem to load fine in all of the different desktop environments however in Fache once again the icon was missing and I had to use a terminal to launch the application the biggest issue with T worlds was the input and the resolution so this is the best candidate for low-hanging fruit in my opinion especially if you want to plug in a mouse and keyboard but like super tux cart was an utter fail post install I know desktop environment with load so reflash the fact that some open source games even partially work is amazing all in all not a bad improvement thanks for watching bye

gnu linux is not unix but it is a hell of an open re-implementation of an operating system originally designed for the pdp-11 all i mean is gnu linux takes the ideas of standard input and output as well as inter-program piping and a hierarch of files and folders from unix but this time using a gpl license to allow users and developers their software freedoms on the labrum 5 the gui stack uses weyland and a shiny ui called fosh built by purism but press ctrl alt f1 and you'll be looking at software that largely resembles code from the 80s and early 90s instead of a mainframe i have this general purpose phone instead of weyland and this nice looking ui i want to use this terminal instead of interfacing with a keyboard i want to interface with the touch screen looking at projects that already exist we have this nice looking keyboard program after building a baker's dozen debs i managed to get this keyboard running nice for whatever reason i can't get this to respond anything except extern style mouse input which is not available as far as i know in this basic terminal past experience has taught me to stay far away from n curses it's just not as hackable as i'd like it to be so instead i built this small library called uicon this is a basic tool that offers keyboard and mouse input and exposes commands to move the cursor and write in any color first up is getting basic touch input in the console looking around gpm the ancient general purpose mouse was looking like a good option i did try using this and it does report touch data as if it was a mouse but the issue is when you touch two different parts of the screen it randomly jumps so gpm is not going to work for me next i tested accessing the screen with the dev device directly i could read events from python but turning this into usable touch coordinates was not going to work just to see what command line solutions there might be i dug into command line tools and found ev test this spits out clear text x and y coordinates when you touch the screen as well as the type of event this feels very old school let's pipe that data into a python process and rip out what we need with this really hacky touch input working i need a way of drawing one or more terminals as well as a way to pass keyboard and touch data onto those terminals as far as i know the closest project is something like demux which is just not built for what i'm trying to do so i built composite term because it's a compositor for terminal windows this sucker is really where the magic's at it lets you open a terminal of any size at any place running any command within the bigger terminal i can start a new bash session or two or use it to render small parts of a new terminal desktop environment this is kind of the first version of what i'm calling moultish a multi-shell touchscreen driven interface for non-x11 or wayland terminals the top menu is its own terminal as well as the bottom menu all open terminals show up as apps on the bottom and can be minimized and unminimized this bottom bar is just a program reading composite terms running file as well as using its hook commands tapping start will open a menu terminal for now the program just waits for a mouse event and starts bash but i'm hoping to add a calls app basic messaging app and simple things like a calculator and tic-tac-toe the on-screen keyboard can be toggled by clicking the top bar this is yet another terminal it also shows up in the menu bar which would benefit from some nice auto refresh with a terminal open you need to make sure it's in focus this is done when you tap any app except the keyboard you can see it still sends click data to every app it really shouldn't do that with a new terminal in focus the on-screen keyboard can send basic characters as well as the enter key the other keys still need some work keyboard events are passed to whatever terminal is in focus which makes using an external keyboard and option if anyone takes a liking to this project or if you want to dig into how it works you can find all the source code online under the gpl3 license thanks for watching bye

=== Networking and OSI Basics ===

computers send and receive data all around the world but just how does that work let's dive in let's start with two computers computer a and computer b cable together with an ethernet cable the ethernet cable itself is just a long run of wires it connects to the computer with a network interface controller most commonly referred to as a nic most computers come with a built-in nick but you can add in an extra if you have available pci lanes nics come with a completely unique id called a mac address and the mac address is similar to a shipping address but for your neck usually you only have one mac address in used by the computer but if you have multiple network interfaces like wi-fi and ethernet a second mac address could be in use the nic itself is able to make and receive signals across the ethernet cable keep in mind this is just a cable where sending down electricity in a specific way sending electricity down a line for some amount of time could indicate a one while the absence of electricity could indicate a zero here's an example computer a sends eight ones or zeros indicating a letter of the alphabet computer b responds back with a message if the letter was received correctly or responds with a different message if the letter needs repeated due to an error what we have defined here is a super basic protocol in reality your nic receives something called frames but in a similar light it has its own protocol defining the meaning in order of the ones and zeros we won't dig in this too much today but your neck card sends small chunks of data over a frame similar to a shipping label the frame has a destination mac and a source mac when a frame is received by your neck it checks to see if the destination mac matches your unique id if it does the data is processed by your computer to the user this process data could look like a web browser loading a bit or a download continuing however these processes could take thousands of frames to complete using macs to address computers works perfectly well if all the computers are directly attached but the internet is made up of a bunch of smaller networks that can all talk to one another computer applications also don't use mac addresses to directly transfer data between each other and said ip addresses are used when a net card receives a frame the data inside usually contains something called a packet similar to the frame protocol the ip protocol defines the order and meaning of the raw ones and zeros coming across the ethernet these packets contain a source and a destination ip as well as a data payload normally each computer has one ip address but each nic attached to a dhcp server will be assigned an ip this is done by the router in most home networks if computer a wants to talk to computer b but computer a only knows the ip address of computer b computer a can use our address resolution protocol to resolve the destination mac this is where a frame is sent to all computers on the network the computer with the matching mac replies back while all other computers ignore the request most home networks use an ip range of 192 168 1 something and have a subnet mask of 255 255 255 0 which is often referred to as a slash 24 network let's look at one of these ips in this example all ips in your network will start with 192 168 1 something dot 11 is unique to this computer on this network slash 24 is the subnet mask the subnet mask more or less defines which part of the ip is common to your network and which part changes per computer in this example all ips starting with 192 1681 are part of your network any ip outside that range needs your router to forward your packet to the proper router if your running table is set up correctly then the next hop or router should be able to resolve the ip into a local mac address or at least be able to forward it on to a router that can there could be any number of these network hops in between you and just about anywhere on the internet of course we don't type in ip addresses to our favorite websites even though we can instead we rely on dns servers if you send a dns server a domain name it will reply back with the ip address tied to the domain name this lets anyone set up a web server then pay for a domain name next they can point that domain name at that ip address people that browse to the site will end up talking to a dns server to find your ip then your data will be hopped across various routers to its end destination at this point computers can route data to various networks using the ip protocol the data in the ip packet usually contain something like tcp which is short for transmission control protocol these protocols often have air correction built in these tcp packets are the basis of how a lot of fundamental applications work including http and https which is how web pages send and receive data head on over to hackers-game.com to find out more thanks for watching bye

=== User Empowered Smartphones ===

it seems clear that around March 2020 anyone that wants to pick up a Linux powered smartphone will have two options the pine phone is a hell of a bargain coming in at only a hundred and fifty dollars while the Lieberman five is expected to have higher build quality performance and security both companies clearly love Linux but they went about developing a Linux powered device a bit differently peers incent deaf kids to anyone that paid for one plus a few given out to the community eventually Pyne 64 on the other hand gave development kits to people with proven OS development backgrounds they were not available for people in the media or Linux enthusiasts it appears a model was nice because it allowed me to follow nearly the entire process of bringing pure OS to the deaf kit while early Pyne phone videos are few and far between but providing hardware to open-source developers is a proven model people donate hardware to open-source projects all the time Pyne 64 is now solving the lack of exposure by releasing the Braveheart edition of the pine phone which is available for order at the moment the OS is that run on the device are still beta and it will not come pre-installed with any OS this is amazing for people like me I can check out a number of os's that are coming to the pine phone even before one is fully usable Pearson on the other hand is sending the early versions of their device to the backers who ordered first there is nothing wrong with this except I likely won't have good access to peers and hardware until our dish if you live near Portland Oregon and are in an early batch feel free to contact me I would love to record your phone and get your impressions of what it's like to use like Apple Pearson has complete control of the hardware and software on the labrum v this puts a lot on their plate they have to design and build working hardware as well as port PR OS to the phone this allows them to create a new ecosystem around peer OS and the Libra meone services that has to be good for business while behind 64 has largely handed off the software side of things to the community which lets them focus on building good hardware but it also means that they will be adopting a current or upcoming mobile Linux ecosystem the Libra 5 wins the freedom contest they are shooting for the respects your freedom certification which no phone has today while the Libra 5 still has some binary blobs that need removed the pine phone is going to be relying on these proprietary blobs in the kernel for you boot for DRAM initialization power management Wi-Fi and baseband the Libra 5 takes another step towards freedom and security they separate that baseband from the main CPU and RAM that way the baseband on your phone can't poke around your running app data is a great idea why are we writing desktop applications and phone apps the Libra 5 and lip handy is the first to try to merge what runs on the Linux desktop 2 what runs on the Linux phone if this ends up being even slightly popular in the open source world a massive collection of ported software and new software will spring up on the phone and on the desktop it's not like I pull up my sailfish OS app on my desktop ever not because I don't want you either it's because they haven't freaking open sourced all the UI components shame plus they aren't adaptive so they wouldn't look quite right on a desktop anyway however I could see myself pulling open a app designed for the leap from 5 on my desktop or even plugging in my labrum 5 into a monitor and using it as a desktop using leap from five apps on a standard Linux desktop might be a bit challenging up until lip handy being up streamed then it'll be entirely trivial come q2 I expect the pine phone will have more OS options while the leap from five will have an officially supported Debian based pure OS and a growing list of alternative os's I have to say though the list of OS is that already run on the pine phone is impressive if you left your Nokia Linux device Maemo less toe can be installed you should totally check out mammal éstos channel it makes me miss my n900 there is also an actor sailfish OS the webOS successor loon OS is also installable check out Kristof's channel for more on that one of the best options is definitely post-market OS check out Martin Brahms channel for more on that he also has videos on ubi ports on a pint phone death kit more videos are definitely needed I would love to see a video of kte nyan Debbie and bass on this device for example over the past two weekends I've been working on an automation app called triggers the idea is to create a app like Tasker but fork and new Linux phones I'm trying to keep the dependencies down so that it can be easily ported or installed on just about any Linux OS add a trigger and at least one action then you create an event which group one trigger and one or many actions at the moment trigger scripts and action scripts are working and I'm working on mock-ups for the time-based triggers compared to making the same app on Android I would say it's about a thousand times better writing in Python gtk than Java so yeah I cannot wait for my brave heart pine phone and my Libra 5 to arrive thanks for watching bye

=== Basic x11 (Linux GUI)... ===

hello and welcome back everybody I'm gonna show you how to do some cool things with x11 while they're still relevant yep anyway I spam escape trying to boot this boot to VM got to my grub screen from here I'm gonna go to eat edit scroll then to the Linux line you know the Linux lineup had a three I was taught that that means booting to run level three um that's more or less emulated these days and you boot - something like run level 3 which is networking but no GUI so if you don't want to start the GUI putting a three here it's a good place to put a three by the way 5 would be default graphical one is recovery 3 non-graphical from here you can just simply press f10 to boot so the reason I'm booting in to run level 3 is so that I can start x11 manually I've set myself a root password so I can login directly as root and the command here is simple attacks in it you can simply run that command by itself with no arguments and it will start on display 0 max 11 runs with different display numbers display 0 is default display 1 is the next one and so on but let's say you already have an X 11 session running on : 0 it's fairly easy to give it a different display number so you can do - - space : and then whatever you want your display number to be one would be the most useful I think because if you already have on running you can start another one I'm gonna go ahead and leave off the arguments and start on to the default display zero shrift day okay you should be greeted with this fancy dancy terminal X term that's default you can also pass in a command to run to X in it but this will do just fine we can start whatever you want from here for example I can type in Firefox and here's Firefox notice you can't really interact with the Firefox because it doesn't have a window manager running and Firefox gets kind of pissy with no window manager Benjy doesn't have a really good one you can start easily by itself that you can start unity that's probably gonna change when known comes around cool unity running as root not a great idea but here it is anyway and once unity is running you can move your windows around and do that fancy window nonsense you

=== 3D Dependency Forest ===

why is it so hard to upgrade or downgrade just one package what is a package dependency and just what would it look like to visualize all of debian's package requirements in 3d space debian is a robust distro of gnu linux based on the dot deb package format these packages are made of files that get extracted to the system and scripts that can be run if needed debs are convenient and proven way to install the base os new applications and required libraries in just about every case an application packaged as a dot deb will have dependencies a dependency is another package your package relies on a good example is the graphical gtk 3 application which needs lib gtk to function in many cases your dependencies will also have dependencies which could also have dependencies and so on the connections between these interdependent packages make up what's known as a dependency tree this dependency tree is a very common image used to depict basic package relationships digging into the origin it seems this image was created with apt-r depends it turns out apt-r-depends is a really handy way of outputting dot graph data which can be piped into a few different programs to create cool looking graphs asking spring graph to graph my entire debian system really didn't work but i was able to create this cool looking guy with sfdp which is part of the package graphis sfdp put everything in a nice circle and can also output data in detail.graph format so i used sfdp to create detailed graph data from the output of appt autopins run on the whole system next i built a handy blender script to render that dot graph data in 2d to give it a third dimension i calculated the height based on the number of other packages using it as a dependency so the most dependent on packages ended up the highest on the z-axis this makes lip c6 the top tree in this cool visualization i'm calling it dependency forest as this is a tight grouping of trees in 3d space the links between packages are really just a list of the package names and the needed versions here's an example from the also utils package by removing or changing any of these packages you could break also utils as well as any other packages that depend on the changed package i bet you could guess why messing with any of these higher depended on packages could cause a problem for the lower parts of the tree thanks for watching bye

=== Chroot into Docker ===

hello and welcome back everyone I'm going to show you how to use docker to to root into any operating system you desire pull up a computer and let's get started docker images will show you which base images are currently installed on the system I have a couple that I'm using for some neural nets we're gonna go ahead and just do a boon to you so first step we're gonna make a directory called the boon to and as you can see right now I'm running Debian so my goal is to be running it boom to you by the end of this inside of a tree root so darker pull preventing that's this is an official tag so it's pretty easy to download and it's supported and maintained by those docker folks now I need to start an instance of the base docker image talk along kicked in boom - alright so this is down inside of the docker image and you can see it is Ubuntu 16 point oh four oh four LCS but that's just using the regular docker method how do we get in here via two routing well we're gonna leave this bash session open come into a new route terminal doctor yes shows us that this is the container ID of that running instance so this is where the magic happens and we can dump the root filesystem it dumps by default to STD out which is literally the screen output but you need to redirect that to a file with the redirect thing so docker export and the container angey then the redirect to a file root dot are what we just did there as we wrote in our archive of the entire root directory into that root our file our dash X evita roots dot R this will extract to my current working directory which is fortunately a temp directory i've made LS again and have a root filesystem from here it's a standard to root so before I do - - by dollar sign I slash dot slash dollar sign I Chi root current working directory that we're going to mount up the thing then we're going to ask myself instead of root environment variables and we're gonna make sure we're running the right operating system and just like that with two rooted into a docker image anything in a docker repositories is a 2 root potentially so that's pretty cool thanks for watching

=== How To Chroot ===

hello and welcome back everybody I'm gonna show you how to chew root into a different Linux operating system so I've got a dual booted Linux system here I've got Seuss's my host operating system i've debian on a different partition I'm gonna mount the root filesystem of Debian into slash Deb so Victor Deb if you need to all right once that's done you can do Alice div and you should be able to see the root filesystem cool the simplest version of this is for I am sis rock and then du and then mount and you're done but um if you want a to root the x11 works in the commands a little bit more complicated you need to do for I and dev dev pts dead of SH M proc sis temp and run so that's the first line do our bind splash mount point slash I done alright let's do an LS of slash deb-deb good we see that's good at this point we can run to boot /r mount then from here we can do an su - that just sets up the root users and violent variables um you can screw around in here and it's a mostly working environment I can do things anyway when you're done screwing around with a terminal um you want x11 exit out of this and type XOS plus and that'll allow basically anything to connect to your x11 session it's not super secure but it's way less complicated for sure anyway back into our Debian system let's run mate panel how about that okey-dokey that doesn't work all the time but I have openSUSE running down here and Debian running up here and it's running its route though do note it's a different user right but to prove it I'll go down here to system open up a terminal and type in the cat slash that's seized rrdl star and you can see this is a Debian and I can even go in here and open out in advance something something here's Inkscape from Debian anyway thanks for watching

=== Librem 5 Development Kit [Onboard Screen] ===

after purism put together the first libram 5 death kit they ran into an unexpected issue the on board displays did not function properly waiting for the on-board displays to function would have resulted in some very lengthy delays but the amazing people over appear is 'm managed to verify the issue was in software and not in hardware and in fact was the initialization sequence of the hardware that was the underlying cause so they felt pretty ok with shipping the hardware despite this initialization issue meaning we had to all go out and buy a stuff needed to hook up a dev kit to a monitor mouse and keyboard it turns out hooking all of these things up is non-trivial due to the fact that USB roll switching is not fully implemented at the moment the folks over appear ISM did manage to figure out how to one time program the screens which was use a special black box to send the initialization sequence to the screen directly once this was done you never had to resend that initialization sequence and the displays just functioned that's great for the people at Pearson who can just get that done anytime but for the developers who didn't have access to the special black box required for the one time programming didn't really have that many options but it was offered at FOSDEM so in early february you could bring your dev kit and have the purism folks one time program it which resulted in new having ain't working screen to test with everyone else didn't have to wait that long though because on February 20th a full software patch was created this allowed the kernel to send that special meaning all we had to do was reflash with the latest peers and builds and our screen should just magically work we flashed the new latest image from purism give it a reboot and it's still a black screen turns out we have one of the dev kits that have a boost display cable this teeny little ribbon cable here has loose in shipping or while we had it or I don't really know probably a while ago and try as we might we just can't get this teeny ass or Ivan cable back in its hole so before we mangle this any more than we've already mangled it it's time to take this guy over to a board repair shop fortunately crafty guy also has a def kit and lives near me crafty guy is working hard on post-market OS which is sure to be one of the more interesting operating systems available for the leap from five this build of post-market OS is defaulting to KDE plasma mobile which does look very nice it's got the standard Android slide down from the top just like Fache the phone application does not have any data so we'll just move on you can see your open applications from here as well as close them and slide up for your apps kind of just like Bosh and so far it's looking like KDE is winning as far as things implemented even though Fache is coming along quite quickly okay I'm sure you've noticed the slow framerate this is caused by the open source GPU driver it still needs work however I do have high hopes for smooth graphics on the dev kit because using Linux frame buffer allows for some pretty smooth graphics anyway thanks for watching bye
