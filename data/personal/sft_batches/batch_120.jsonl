Why do people care so much about being a millennial or Gen Z?\n<|assistant|>\nBecause they are mostly made up — Strauss and Howe basically invented the modern framework and marketers ran with it.

The owners... less so.\n<|assistant|>\nThe dogs are elite athletes carrying their handlers through the course. Half the faults in agility come from the human giving late signals or running the wrong path while their border collie does calculus in real time to compensate. The weak link is always the two-legged one.\n<|user|>\nWhy don't they just let the dogs run it alone?\n<|assistant|>\nSome dogs basically do. The best agility dogs are reading the course three obstacles ahead and barely glancing at their handler. The partnership is the point of the sport, but the dogs would absolutely post faster times solo.\n<|user|>\nWhat breed dominates?\n<|assistant|>\nBorder collies run agility like they were designed for it, because genetically, they kind of were. Herding instinct plus insane athleticism plus a neurotic need to work equals an agility machine. Shelties and Aussies compete, but border collies are the final boss.", "topic": "The strange world of competitive dog agility where the owner is always the weak link"}
