Nobody was testing duck quacks in anechoic chambers until researchers at Salford University did it in 2003, probably because they were tired of the myth.\n<|user|>\nand it does echo?\n<|assistant|>\nOf course it echoes. Sound echoes. That's what sound does. The finding was that the echo blends smoothly into the trailing end of the quack, making it less noticeable than, say, a clap or a shout.\n<|user|>\nso it's technically more of a soft echo\n<|assistant|>\nRight.

They also form living rafts when flooded — the whole colony floats as a unit, queen at the center.\n<|user|>\nhow do they know where to put the bridge\n<|assistant|>\nEmerging behavior from simple rules. Ants slow down where the terrain is rough, which causes a traffic jam, which causes bridging behavior. No ant is planning the bridge — the bridge is a consequence of local interactions. Classic self-organization.\n<|user|>\nthe raft thing is wild though, how do they not drown\n<|assistant|>\nAir bubbles trapped in the ant mass and water-repellent exoskeletons.

This is cooperative breeding — helpers raise offspring that aren't their own, at cost to themselves.\n<|user|>\nwhy would they do that if it's not their kids\n<|assistant|>\nFew reasons debated: kin selection if most helpers are related, reciprocal altruism if roles rotate, and benefits from group size — bigger group means better predator detection and foraging.

But status quo bias makes those costs feel larger than they are, and the inertia is what banks count on.\n<|user|>\ninsurance companies too?\n<|assistant|>\nInsurance might be the purest example.
