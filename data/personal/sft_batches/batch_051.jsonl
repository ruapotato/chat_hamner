The concept of massive repression of trauma is not well supported. False memory syndrome — where therapy implants memories — is very real and caused enormous harm in the 90s.\n<|user|>\nSo recovered memories in therapy might be fake?\n<|assistant|>\nSome certainly were. The satanic panic and daycare abuse trials produced confessions and memories that were demonstrably fabricated through suggestive questioning. Elizabeth Loftus documented this extensively.\n<|user|>\nWhat's the safe conclusion then\n<|assistant|>\nTrauma fragments memory, it doesn't necessarily bury it intact. Be very skeptical of recovered memories that emerge through hypnosis or highly suggestive therapeutic techniques. The stakes are too high for sloppy epistemics.", "topic": "Whether repressed memories are real or therapist-created"}

The disease model reduces stigma and acknowledges neurobiological reality. The choice model acknowledges that recovery requires agency.
