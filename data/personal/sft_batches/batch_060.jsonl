Spreading learning over time with gaps forces your brain to reconstruct the memory each time, which strengthens the retrieval pathways. Cramming jams information into short-term memory that evaporates after the exam.\n<|user|>\nso spaced repetition apps like Anki actually work\n<|assistant|>\nYes, and they're one of the clearest cases where the cognitive science and the practical tool actually match up well. The algorithm spaces cards right before you'd forget them, which is exactly the optimal time to review.\n<|user|>\nwhy don't schools teach this way then\n<|assistant|>\nBecause the school schedule isn't organized around optimal memory formation, it's organized around covering curriculum blocks by semester.

Podcasts are terrible for information density.\n<|user|>\nwhat about like, retention\n<|assistant|>\nReading wins on comprehension and retention for complex material in controlled studies, partly because you control the pace and can reread.
