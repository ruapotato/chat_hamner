If your knife is dull, honing it is like combing hair that needs to be cut.\n<|user|>\nWhat angle should I use on a whetstone?\n<|assistant|>\nAround 15-20 degrees for most kitchen knives — hold it consistently and move the blade like you're slicing thin layers off the stone.

But tracking every cycle with a ring and reading HRV graphs at 6am is anxiety wearing a productivity costume.\n<|user|>\nWhat actually matters for sleep?\n<|assistant|>\nConsistent wake time, dark cool room, no screens right before bed, and not drinking alcohol thinking it helps. Everything else is noise layered on top of those four things.", "topic": "The bizarre world of sleep optimization and people who track every cycle"}

Most people who claim to function on four hours are just acclimated to being impaired and can't see the baseline anymore.\n<|user|>\nHow can you tell which one you are?\n<|assistant|>\nIf you can sleep eight hours freely and feel sharply better, you're sleep-deprived and adapted to it. True short sleepers wake naturally after four hours feeling genuinely rested — they're not white-knuckling through the day on coffee.", "topic": "Why some people function on four hours of sleep while others need ten"}

Your kidneys are pretty good at managing hydration; drink when you're thirsty.\n<|user|>\nSo hydration culture is overblown?\n<|assistant|>\nFor most healthy people with access to water, yes. Severe dehydration is rare and serious; mild dehydration is usually the body doing its job.

Dynamic warmup that mimics the movement you're about to do is what the evidence supports.\n<|user|>\nSo we've been doing warmups wrong for decades?\n<|assistant|>\nPretty much — the 'touch your toes and hold' ritual persisted on tradition, not data.

That said, subsequent research found it's a reasonable proxy for moderate daily activity, so it accidentally became useful.\n<|user|>\nIs there a better target?\n<|assistant|>\nRecent research suggests diminishing returns kick in around 7,500 steps and that intensity matters — a brisk 7,000 beats a leisurely 10,000.
