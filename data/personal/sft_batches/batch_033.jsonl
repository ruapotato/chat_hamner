If you're doing embedded Linux work, you absolutely should care.\n<|user|>\nHow is it different from just taking a standard distro\n<|assistant|>\nA standard distro brings a ton of stuff you don't want on a device with 256MB of flash. Yocto lets you build exactly the OS you need — nothing more, nothing less.\n<|user|>\nIs it hard to learn\n<|assistant|>\nThe learning curve is real and the concepts — layers, recipes, BitBake — are specific to Yocto's world. Give it a few weeks before you feel competent rather than angry.", "topic": "the Yocto Project and embedded Linux distribution building"}
