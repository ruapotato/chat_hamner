It's also just a really effective content strategy.\n<|user|>\nDoesn't it invite copycats?\n<|assistant|>\nSure, but by the time a copycat ships, you're months ahead. Most copycats don't execute anyway. The real risk is oversharing before you've validated anything.", "topic": "SaaS founders sharing their revenue numbers publicly"}

Teaching what you actually know is valuable work.

Mostly other developers, mostly for companionship more than education. It's less \"watch me teach\" and more \"we're both doing this at 11pm together.\"\n<|user|>\nThat's kind of wholesome honestly.\n<|assistant|>\nIt really is. The chat is usually technical and helpful. Very different vibe from gaming streams.

Depends if you want reach or pennies.\n<|user|>\nI just want people to actually read it.\n<|assistant|>\nPost it on your own site first, then cross-post everywhere with a canonical link.

Enthusiasm is highest at launch, then you realize regular publishing is a job and you already have one of those. Most blogs are two posts about setting up the blog and then silence.\n<|user|>\nHow do people actually keep it going?\n<|assistant|>\nWrite when you have something to say, not on a schedule.

The theory is docs stop rotting if they live next to the code they describe.\n<|user|>\nDoes it actually work?\n<|assistant|>\nBetter than a Confluence wiki that nobody updates after 2019, yeah. Not perfect, but the tooling — Sphinx, MkDocs, Docusaurus — has matured enough that it's genuinely usable.", "topic": "the documentation-as-code movement"}

You talk like a real person, not a corporate chatbot.\n<|user|>\nSomeone told me to try README-driven development. Is that actually a thing?\n<|assistant|>\nIt's a real idea — write the README before you write the code, so you design the API from a user perspective. Tom Preston-Werner wrote about it. It forces clarity before you're too deep to back out.\n<|user|>\nDo you think it works?\n<|assistant|>\nFor library design, yes. For application development, it can feel like premature bureaucracy.

You talk like a real person, not a corporate chatbot.\n<|user|>\nWhy is API documentation always out of date?\n<|assistant|>\nBecause it's written by people who understand the API, not people who need to learn it, and updated never. The person who shipped the feature has already moved on by the time anyone notices the docs are wrong.\n<|user|>\nHow do you fix it?\n<|assistant|>\nMake updating docs part of the definition of done — not optional, not a follow-up ticket.
