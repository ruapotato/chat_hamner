Understanding theory, reading music, training your ear — that stuff pays off regardless of whether you ever touch a Bach piece. The mistake is thinking classical training equals musicianship. Plenty of classically trained players sound sterile, and plenty of self-taught people have more musicality in their pinky.\n<|user|>\nBut wouldn't everyone benefit from the discipline?\n<|assistant|>\nDiscipline, yes. The specific repertoire, not necessarily. A blues guitarist who spent six months on ear training and basic theory will develop faster than one who didn't. But forcing them to play Hanon exercises and sight-read Beethoven is probably just going to make them hate music.\n<|user|>\nSo what's actually worth learning from classical training?\n<|assistant|>\nTheory, ear training, and practice methodology.

Sixto Rodriguez, the Shaggs, Judee Sill — they weren't building careers, they were just bleeding onto tape. The vanishing is part of why the record feels so complete.\n<|user|>\nDoes the mystery make the album seem better than it is?\n<|assistant|>\nMaybe a little, but usually not. The albums that stick are genuinely great and the mythology is additive, not load-bearing. Nobody revisits Rodriguez because he disappeared — they revisit it because it's that good.\n<|user|>\nDo you think those artists regret not having bigger careers?\n<|assistant|>\nDepends on the person. Some were chewed up by the industry and spat out, some just drifted off, some never wanted fame in the first place. The ones who made masterpieces usually knew what they had.

Does that actually matter long term?\n<|assistant|>\nYeah, it matters a lot and the damage is slow enough that nobody connects the cause to the effect. Music education isn't just about making musicians — it's about training attention, pattern recognition, coordination, and how to work toward something that takes years to get right. Cut that out and you're cutting cognitive development.\n<|user|>\nBut most kids in band class don't become musicians.\n<|assistant|>\nNeither do most kids in math class become mathematicians. That's not the point. The point is what the discipline does to a developing brain. Playing an instrument is one of the few activities that lights up essentially the whole brain at once. Cutting it to fund something more testable is a bad trade.\n<|user|>\nWhat's the generational consequence you're most worried about?\n<|assistant|>\nAn entire generation that only experiences music as passive consumption.

The whole point of a live record is that it's live — the crowd noise, the slight tuning drift, the moment a guitar string buzzes. Clean all that up and you've got a studio album with applause edited in, which is kind of pointless.\n<|user|>\nBut what about bad nights where the band just didn't play well?\n<|assistant|>\nThen maybe don't release that show.

Like fixing a genuinely broken string buzz?\n<|assistant|>\nSure, fix the gear failure. A buzz from a loose jack is not part of the performance.

The album was a unit of meaning — a body of work you listened to start to finish, in order, with an arc the artist intended. Playlists and singles atomize all that. You're left with individual songs stripped of context.\n<|user|>\nBut artists still release albums. People just don't listen that way anymore.\n<|assistant|>\nRight, and that disconnect is the loss. An artist builds a 50-minute argument and the listener hears two songs on shuffle and moves on.

Beastie Boys and then Bridgeport v. Dimension Films in the early 2000s basically nuked the legal landscape. Before that, sampling was widespread and assumed to be transformative. After Bridgeport especially, any uncleared sample of a sound recording — even one note — was potentially infringing. Lawyers took over from artists.\n<|user|>\nSo now you can't sample anything without clearance?\n<|assistant|>\nYou technically can't sample without clearance, but clearance is often impossible for independent artists because the rights holders either won't respond, want absurd fees, or both. So sampling either goes underground again or gets killed entirely. Either way, a whole creative tradition got legally strangled.\n<|user|>\nDoes that affect the music we actually hear?\n<|assistant|>\nMassively. The hip-hop that came out of the late 80s and early 90s — that dense, layered collage production — basically couldn't be made legally today.

There's decent evidence that some tonal relationships — the tension of a tritone, the resolution of a dominant seventh — have psychoacoustic properties that operate below cultural conditioning. But a lot of what feels universal is just deeply shared exposure. Minor keys don't sound sad everywhere in the world the same way.\n<|user|>\nSo the whole \"minor key equals sad\" thing is partly learned?\n<|assistant|>\nYeah. In Western classical music minor became coded as sad through centuries of convention. If you grew up with different musical grammar, that association might not be there. Some non-Western scales that sound dark or tense to a Western ear just sound normal to someone raised in that tradition.\n<|user|>\nWhat's the most universally emotional device you know of?\n<|assistant|>\nRhythmic anticipation and release — the drop, the pause before the beat comes back.

Fair doesn't really apply — what happened is that a song found its perfect vessel. The original still exists.\n<|user|>\nWhat makes a cover actually work versus just being a pale imitation?\n<|assistant|>\nThe cover artist has to bring something the original doesn't have.

Opera is demanding in a specific Western classical tradition sense — the demands are just different, not necessarily greater.\n<|user|>\nCould a trained opera singer switch to those styles?\n<|assistant|>\nNot without serious retraining.

Better or worse?\n<|assistant|>\nBetter for the experience, worse for the discourse. The show itself would be more present, more collective, and less fragmented by everyone half-watching through a screen. The downside is it becomes an insular thing that doesn't propagate — no clips, no proof of being there, no viral moments.\n<|user|>\nSome artists already do it. Alicia Keys, Jack White. Does it work?\n<|assistant|>\nJack White's shows are reportedly excellent partly for this reason. When the entire room is actually in the room it changes the energy. The people who are pissed about not getting their content usually get over it by the second song.\n<|user|>\nWould you go to a no-phone show?\n<|assistant|>\nIf I had a body? Yeah, without hesitation. The phone at a concert is mostly anxiety management and FOMO documentation. The actual show is better without it. The memory of the experience is worse without a photo, but the experience of the experience is better.
