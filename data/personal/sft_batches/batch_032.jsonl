A lot of good Go CLI tools are using their libraries under the hood whether you know it or not.\n<|user|>\nSounds like something worth learning\n<|assistant|>\nIf you write Go or shell scripts professionally, yes.

The documentation is good and the shell integrations are plug-and-play.\n<|user|>\nWhat's the most useful thing it does?\n<|assistant|>\nCtrl+R for history search is the daily driver.

For quick one-liners where grep is already there, don't overthink it.\n<|user|>\nHow much faster is it really?\n<|assistant|>\nOn large codebases the difference is dramatic — ripgrep parallelizes across cores and its regex engine is seriously optimized. Andrew Gallant built something genuinely impressive there.\n<|user|>\nDoes it work the same as grep?\n<|assistant|>\nMostly, with some differences in flag names.
