Should I be?\n<|assistant|>\nMontessori has real research behind it — better self-regulation, intrinsic motivation, mixed-age collaboration. Traditional schooling does compliance very well, which is either a feature or a bug depending on what you want from childhood.\n<|user|>\nBut does it actually produce better outcomes long-term?\n<|assistant|>\nThe studies are promising but messy — Montessori schools vary enormously in quality, and selection effects are brutal to control for. Kids from families who seek out Montessori often do well regardless of the method.\n<|user|>\nSo the evidence isn't conclusive.\n<|assistant|>\nNot conclusive, but not nothing either. The honest answer is that a good Montessori school probably beats a mediocre traditional one, and a great traditional school probably beats both.", "topic": "Whether Montessori and alternative education methods produce different outcomes"}

The randomness is a feature for some schools — it keeps applicants anxious and application rates high.\n<|user|>\nWhy do families spend so much money gaming it then?\n<|assistant|>\nBecause the expected value of a top school is high enough that even a small probability boost justifies obscene spending — for families who can afford it.

The problem is that the people who need the gym membership's social accountability often stop using the home gym exactly when they need it most.\n<|user|>\nI bought a treadmill four years ago that is currently a clothes rack.\n<|assistant|>\nThe clothes rack treadmill is the single most common piece of home gym equipment in existence. The gym would have kept you more accountable, but the clothes rack is technically worth something on resale.\n<|user|>\nWhat actually works for home gyms?\n<|assistant|>\nDumbbell set, pull-up bar, and a floor mat will get most people 80% of the way there at under $300.

Real-world range while towing is often 40-50% of the advertised figure.\n<|user|>\nWhy are the numbers so far off?\n<|assistant|>\nTest conditions are optimized for the test. Trailer aerodynamics, hills, speed, and climate control all hammer EV range in ways the rating cycle doesn't fully capture.

The car isn't special; the moment is, and the car is the physical anchor.\n<|user|>\nIt wasn't even a good car.\n<|assistant|>\nIt doesn't matter.

The EV Porsche Taycan has fans who are absolutely car people.\n<|user|>\nBut isn't the sound and feel of a combustion engine a huge part of it?\n<|assistant|>\nFor a lot of people, yes.

Some people don't trust a quick-lube shop to actually use the oil they paid for and torque the drain plug correctly. Doing it yourself means knowing it was done right.\n<|user|>\nThat makes sense for people who've been burned before.\n<|assistant|>\nExactly.

Twenty years of sustained focus on anything is remarkable — the patience, the skill accumulation, the knowledge of one specific object. The fact that it's a car makes it neither more nor less valid than any other craft obsession.\n<|user|>\nDo these guys actually drive them?\n<|assistant|>\nSome do.

A car you spent twenty years building is going to have a different relationship to risk than a daily driver.\n<|user|>\nWhat happens after it's finally done?\n<|assistant|>\nThey start another one.

They also generate significant revenue, which creates a perverse incentive to place them strategically rather than safely.\n<|user|>\nSo the government can claim safety while collecting money.\n<|assistant|>\nExactly. The suspicion isn't paranoid — there's documented evidence of camera placement near revenue targets rather than accident hotspots in some jurisdictions. When the incentive is money, you should expect money-seeking behavior.\n<|user|>\nWhat would make them more legitimate?\n<|assistant|>\nRevenue going into a ring-fenced safety fund, independent placement decisions based on accident data only, and evidence-based speed limits.

The problem is people buying them for highway-heavy commutes where the hybrid system barely activates.\n<|user|>\nI mostly drive highway. Does a hybrid even help me?\n<|assistant|>\nMinimally.
