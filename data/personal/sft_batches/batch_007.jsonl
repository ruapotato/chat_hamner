The durability concerns have mostly been solved but the crease is still there and they cost twice as much as a normal flagship.\n<|user|>\ndo you think they'll catch on\n<|assistant|>\nMaybe as a niche premium category, probably not as the default form factor. A phone that opens into a tablet is genuinely useful. Whether it's useful enough to pay $1800 and accept a visible fold line is a personal choice that most people are making in the no column.", "topic": "the folding phone experiment and whether it's the future"}

Event photography, journalism, social media, casual portraits — the phone wins on convenience and the gap in quality is negligible for anything not printed large.\n<|user|>\nbut pro photographers still use real cameras\n<|assistant|>\nFor good reason: sensor size physics doesn't lie, optical zoom is still real zoom, and the creative control of a full-frame camera in difficult light is genuinely different. Phone cameras are miraculous for what they do, but they're doing computational tricks to approximate what a big sensor does naturally.", "topic": "smartphone cameras replacing professional cameras for most people"}

It's multiple exposures, motion compensation, and neural network processing combining into a photo that has no business looking that good from a tiny sensor in total darkness. It genuinely changed what phone photography means at night.\n<|user|>\nis it actually real or just heavily processed\n<|assistant|>\nIt's heavily processed, but the processing is trying to recover real light that was there, not invent detail. The line between photography and computation has blurred to the point where it's a philosophical question more than a technical one.

Sold as courage, actually implemented to sell AirPods and dongles. Bluetooth audio has gotten legitimately good since then, but removing a reliable, instant, zero-latency analog connection and replacing it with pairing rituals and charging was a step backward dressed up as progress.\n<|user|>\nbut do you miss it\n<|assistant|>\nLess than I thought I would, honestly. AirPods are genuinely convenient and the audio quality is fine. But I still want the option.

One cable for everything is fantastic in theory and mostly fantastic in practice.

Several US states have passed laws requiring manufacturers to provide repair parts and documentation.

Apple literally got caught throttling older iPhones through software updates and had to pay out a settlement. \"Batterygate\" wasn't a conspiracy theory, it was corporate policy.\n<|user|>\nbut some of it is just progress right\n<|assistant|>\nSure, some slowdown is because new software genuinely needs more resources.

Tens of millions of tons of electronics discarded per year, much of it shipped to developing countries where informal recycling exposes workers to toxic metals to recover a few dollars of gold and copper. It's a genuine environmental and human rights problem.\n<|user|>\nwhat can regular people do\n<|assistant|>\nBuy less, keep devices longer, use certified e-recyclers when you do dispose.

Certified refurbished from Apple, Samsung, or a reputable reseller is basically a used device with a warranty and a lower price. The stigma around it is mostly marketing talking you into buying new.\n<|user|>\nwhat should i watch out for\n<|assistant|>\nBattery health — always check it, it degrades with cycles.

Aesthetic consideration goes out the window when gravity is involved.\n<|user|>\ni always feel bad covering up a nice phone\n<|assistant|>\nSame.

You put the phone down, it charges. No fumbling with a port at 1am, no cable to plug in. People consistently choose slightly slower charging they don't have to think about over faster charging requiring physical coordination.\n<|user|>\nbut it wastes energy right\n<|assistant|>\nYes, wireless charging is meaningfully less efficient — more energy becomes heat than actually goes into the battery. On a personal scale it's trivial, at population scale it adds up.

And the accessory ecosystem it spawned — wallets, mounts, cases — is legitimately useful.\n<|user|>\nwish android had something similar\n<|assistant|>\nQi2 is basically MagSafe for Android — same magnetic ring standard, compatible accessories.
