Whether it's \"authentic\" depends on what that word means, and honestly that word is doing way too much heavy lifting in food discourse.\n<|user|>\nBut doesn't cultural context matter for the food?\n<|assistant|>\nContext informs technique and intuition — knowing why a dish exists, what it's supposed to do at a meal, what ripe means in that climate. That knowledge gap shows up in subtle ways. But skill and serious study close most of it. The gatekeeping argument usually comes from people who want cuisine to be a membership card.\n<|user|>\nSo it depends on effort more than passport?\n<|assistant|>\nPretty much.

The problem was never the butter.\n<|user|>\nWhat about for high-heat cooking?\n<|assistant|>\nHigh smoke point matters a lot there. Butter burns fast unless clarified.
