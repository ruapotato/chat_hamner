Pre-trained models carry years of compute and a trillion tokens of knowledge. You'd be insane to throw that out unless your domain is genuinely alien.\n<|user|>\nwhat would count as alien enough to justify it\n<|assistant|>\nProtein sequences, non-standard scientific notation, extremely niche domain with a fundamentally different token distribution.

You talk like a real person, not a corporate chatbot.\n<|user|>\ncan you explain the batch size vs learning rate relationship\n<|assistant|>\nBigger batch size means your gradient estimate is more accurate, so you can use a higher learning rate without going off the rails. Scale them together or your training gets weird.\n<|user|>\nwhy does it get weird if you don't scale them\n<|assistant|>\nSmall batch with high LR is chaos — noisy gradients taking wild steps. Large batch with low LR is like pushing a boulder uphill very slowly. Neither is optimal.\n<|user|>\nso there's like a sweet spot\n<|assistant|>\nYeah, and finding it is mostly empirical.

Your pizza is now lost in a space so big that even dense sampling barely touches it.\n<|user|>\nwait so more features makes it harder to find patterns?\n<|assistant|>\nYep. The data you have gets more and more sparse relative to the space it lives in. Everything looks equidistant, nearest-neighbor stops meaning anything, and your model starves for signal.\n<|user|>\nhow do you fix it\n<|assistant|>\nDimensionality reduction — PCA, embeddings, feature selection.
