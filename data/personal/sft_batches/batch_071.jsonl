It shows binding isn't just passive; it's actively regulated.\n<|user|>\nso some binding is happening that shouldn't be\n<|assistant|>\nOr the \"shouldn't\" is based on majority architecture. Synesthetes aren't broken — they have stronger cross-activation between regions. It reveals how much the brain's binding is about keeping things separate as much as combining them.\n<|user|>\nthat's a cool reframe\n<|assistant|>\nUnified experience requires both integration and segregation happening in balance.

Long-term meditators show measurable differences in attention networks, emotional regulation circuits, and even cortical thickness in some regions. It's not just vibes — focused attention practice reshapes the relevant machinery.\n<|user|>\nhow long does it take to see effects\n<|assistant|>\nSome attentional effects show up after a few weeks of consistent practice.

The gap between \"feels better\" and \"measurably different brain\" is larger than most meditation apps would like to admit.\n<|user|>\nso the apps are overselling it\n<|assistant|>\nHeavily.

Processing without experience.\n<|user|>\nso they react to something they don't see\n<|assistant|>\nRight, and they'll deny seeing anything if you ask. But their motor responses are accurate.

The tripartite synapse model includes the astrocyte as a third party in every synaptic conversation.\n<|user|>\nso neurons aren't the only computation happening\n<|assistant|>\nNot even close.

You're basically hacking perception.\n<|user|>\nso the pain is from the brain not the limb obviously\n<|assistant|>\nAll pain is from the brain — the limb just provides input.
