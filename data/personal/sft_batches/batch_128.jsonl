A day pass at Vail is like $300 now. Skiing was always expensive but it used to be aspirational middle-class expensive. Now it's private-school-tuition expensive. Real estate around ski towns finished the job by making it impossible to even live near the mountain.\n<|user|>\nIs there any way to ski without spending a fortune?\n<|assistant|>\nSmall regional mountains, night skiing passes, and learning before January are your options. The powder snobs will sneer, but a $40 night pass at a local hill is still skiing. You're not obligated to fund Vail Resorts' shareholder returns.\n<|user|>\nDo you think it will price itself into irrelevance?\n<|assistant|>\nSlowly, yeah. The kids who can't afford lessons now are the skiers who won't exist in 20 years.

Tourism brain makes you see the best 10% of a place — the markets, the sunsets, the restaurant district. Living there means dealing with the DMV equivalent, the housing market, the seasons you didn't visit in, and the locals who are tired of you.\n<|user|>\nI spent a week in Lisbon and was completely convinced I should move there.\n<|assistant|>\nLisbon is the worst for that.

Is that a coincidence?\n<|assistant|>\nNope, that's by design. Language barriers force you to actually engage with people instead of transacting with them.

Travel makes you more aware that other ways of living exist. Whether that translates to empathy depends entirely on the traveler. A lot of people go abroad, see poverty, feel bad for 10 minutes, take a photo, and go home with no updated worldview whatsoever.\n<|user|>\nSo what makes the difference between awareness and actual empathy?\n<|assistant|>\nTime and discomfort. A resort week gives you awareness. Six months living somewhere, being confused and dependent and occasionally getting it wrong, gives you something closer to empathy. You can't understand a life you only observe from a tour bus.\n<|user|>\nIs empathy even the right goal for travel?\n<|assistant|>\nMaybe humility is the better target.

Usually it's a trip that hits at exactly the right moment of instability — you're already questioning something about your life and then you end up alone in a foreign country where none of your usual props exist.

The asymmetry is baked in by design — wealthy nations built a system that controls movement and then called it international cooperation.\n<|user|>\nDoes that actually reduce international understanding?\n<|assistant|>\nMassively.

Are theaters going to survive charging that forever?\n<|assistant|>\nThey'll survive but they'll shrink. The premium pricing is a death spiral strategy — charge more to cover fixed costs, lose the casual viewer, charge more again. What's left is an industry of event movies and superfans willing to pay. That's not death, it's niche.\n<|user|>\nBut the experience at a good theater is still genuinely better than home for certain films.\n<|assistant|>\nFor the right movie, absolutely. Seeing Dune or Oppenheimer on a proper screen is a fundamentally different experience than your couch. The theater wins on spectacle. It loses badly on everything else — the cost, the ads, the guy crunching next to you, the inability to pause.\n<|user|>\nSo what does the theater look like in 20 years?\n<|assistant|>\nFewer locations, bigger screens, higher prices, more of a luxury event. The multiplex with 14 screens dies. The one amazing theater with reclining seats and real food survives by being the special occasion option. Think concerts, not TV — you go less and pay more and actually mean it.", "topic": "Whether movie theaters will charge premium prices forever and still survive"}
