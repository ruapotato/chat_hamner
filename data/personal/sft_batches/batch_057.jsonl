Selling a losing stock makes the loss real — it goes from a paper loss to an actual loss, and your brain treats those differently even though economically they're the same thing.\n<|user|>\nso people would rather keep pretending they haven't lost\n<|assistant|>\nExactly. Studies show investors hold losing stocks about twice as long as winning ones, which is exactly backwards from rational strategy. You should let winners run and cut losers, but the psychology pushes the opposite.\n<|user|>\nwhat's the fix, just knowing about the bias?\n<|assistant|>\nKnowing helps a little but not as much as you'd hope.

Politicians argue wars, disasters, and stimulus create economic activity, which is true in the narrow visible sense but ignores the opportunity cost of where that money came from.\n<|user|>\nso every time someone says \"this disaster created jobs\" they're doing the fallacy\n<|assistant|>\nBasically, yeah. The jobs are real. So is the wealth destroyed. The fallacy is accounting only for the jobs.

Simon Kuznets, who invented it, explicitly warned in the 1930s that it shouldn't be used as a welfare measure. Everyone ignored him.\n<|user|>\nare there better alternatives\n<|assistant|>\nSeveral — the Human Development Index, Genuine Progress Indicator, measures of median income, life expectancy, happiness surveys.

In a standard English auction, bid your true maximum value and stop — overbidding is the classic mistake. In a sealed-bid first-price auction, you shade your bid below your true value to leave yourself a margin.\n<|user|>\nwhy do different auction formats change the strategy\n<|assistant|>\nBecause the information structure and payment rules change. In a second-price sealed bid — Vickrey auction — bidding your true value is the dominant strategy because you pay the second-highest bid, not your own. Game theory works out clean there.\n<|user|>\nwhat's the winner's curse then\n<|assistant|>\nIn auctions for uncertain-value items like oil drilling rights, the winning bidder is probably the one who most overestimated the value.

Individual outcomes are unpredictable, but aggregate outcomes across thousands of policyholders are highly predictable. The company is essentially betting you'll pay more in premiums than you'll cost in claims, and the math works out across the pool.\n<|user|>\nbut then why is it good for me to buy it\n<|assistant|>\nBecause you're risk-averse and the insurer is risk-neutral — they don't care about any individual outcome. You'd pay more than expected value to avoid a catastrophic loss; they'll take that premium. Both sides are getting what they value.\n<|user|>\nwhat breaks that deal\n<|assistant|>\nAdverse selection. If only sick people buy health insurance, the risk pool skews expensive and premiums have to rise, which drives out healthy people, which raises premiums more.

The answer is marginal utility — value isn't determined by total usefulness but by the value of the next unit in a given context.\n<|user|>\ncan you explain that with the actual example\n<|assistant|>\nYou have plenty of water, so the marginal value of one more glass is low. You have few or no diamonds, so the marginal value of one is high. Scarcity and context determine price, not total importance to human survival.\n<|user|>\nso if water was scarce it would cost more than diamonds\n<|assistant|>\nIn a desert, absolutely.

Banks knew — or reasonably believed — they'd be rescued if they got big enough to threaten the system.\n<|user|>\nso they took bigger risks because of the safety net\n<|assistant|>\nThat's the argument. \"Too big to fail\" means heads I win, tails the taxpayer loses.
