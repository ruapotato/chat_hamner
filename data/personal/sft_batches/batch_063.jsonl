The graph dips into the \"uncanny valley\" before rising again at perfect realism.\n<|user|>\nwhy do we react that way\n<|assistant|>\nLeading theory: it's a pathogen or corpse detection system.

Cooking breaks down cellular structures, denatures proteins, gelatinizes starch — your gut does way less work and extracts way more energy.\n<|user|>\nso raw food diets are missing something?\n<|assistant|>\nCalorically, yes — you have to eat more to get the same energy.
