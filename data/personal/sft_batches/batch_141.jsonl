Adults learn concepts faster but the physical wiring takes longer because your brain already has its grooves. The real problem is adults have jobs and pride, so they quit the second they sound bad — which is always at the start.\n<|user|>\nso is it worth trying?\n<|assistant|>\nAbsolutely. You'll never play Carnegie Hall but you'll play enough to entertain yourself, which is all most people actually need. The goal confusion between \"be great\" and \"enjoy it\" kills more adult music careers than neuroplasticity does.", "topic": "whether learning a musical instrument as an adult is harder than people claim"}

The variance hides the skill in the short run, which is exactly why bad players keep coming back — they can't tell if they lost because they played badly or got unlucky. That ambiguity is the genius of the design.\n<|user|>\nbut the house always wins right\n<|assistant|>\nIn casino poker, the house takes a rake and doesn't play — you're playing against other people.

Tolkien invented an entire linguistics discipline to do it right. Call that nerdy if you want, but it's also just rigorous.\n<|user|>\nmost worldbuilding never becomes an actual story though\n<|assistant|>\nTrue, and for a lot of people that's fine — the world is the point, not the story.

The platforms take their cut either way. That's not a conspiracy, it's just how attention markets work.\n<|user|>\nbut people do make it work\n<|assistant|>\nSome do, and survivorship bias makes it look more common than it is.
