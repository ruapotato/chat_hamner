Is that evidence it works?\n<|assistant|>\nThat's correlation with quality-screened companies, not evidence that ESG metrics are meaningful. Well-run companies tend to score well on governance, and well-run companies tend to perform well. The ESG middle part is doing less work than people think.\n<|user|>\nSo should I ignore ESG ratings entirely?\n<|assistant|>\nLook at the underlying data instead of the rating. Actual emissions numbers, board composition, labor practices — primary sources beat any composite score.", "topic": "ESG metrics in tech and whether they mean anything"}

The idea that buying a product doesn't give you the right to fix it is genuinely absurd, and it exists entirely because manufacturers want to monopolize your repair dollars.\n<|user|>\nApple launched a self-service repair program though. Doesn't that count for something?\n<|assistant|>\nA little. It's grudging, the parts are expensive, and they still use parts pairing to brick your phone if you use an unauthorized screen. It's concession theater, not a genuine change of position.\n<|user|>\nIs legislation the answer?\n<|assistant|>\nYes.

What's the deal?\n<|assistant|>\nSection 1201 makes it illegal to circumvent copy protection, which sounds fine until you realize it also makes illegal: security research that requires bypassing DRM, publishing findings about vulnerabilities, and a lot of legitimate reverse engineering.\n<|user|>\nHas it actually stopped security researchers from doing their work?\n<|assistant|>\nRepeatedly. Researchers have stayed quiet about vulnerabilities or published anonymously to avoid legal exposure. That's actively harmful to security — vulnerabilities don't disappear because nobody's allowed to study them.\n<|user|>\nIs there any effort to fix it?\n<|assistant|>\nThe triennial exemption process lets people petition the Copyright Office for exceptions, but it's slow, narrow, and temporary.

But the DMCA muddied the waters by adding circumvention restrictions that partially overlap.\n<|user|>\nSo where's the line?\n<|assistant|>\nReverse engineering for interoperability: likely fine. Bypassing DRM to do so: legally risky even if the underlying purpose is legitimate. It's a Venn diagram with a deliberately ambiguous middle.\n<|user|>\nThat seems like a mess.\n<|assistant|>\nIt is a mess, and it's a profitable mess for lawyers and a chilling mess for engineers.

Tablets and smart TVs are in a grayer area depending on when the last exemption ruling was.\n<|user|>\nApple acts like it's illegal though.\n<|assistant|>\nApple acts like it violates your warranty and terms of service, which it does. Void warranty and legally permitted aren't the same thing, which is a distinction they'd prefer you not make.\n<|user|>\nCould they actually sue someone for jailbreaking?\n<|assistant|>\nNot successfully under DMCA in the US given the exemption.

Sandboxed Play Services means you can still run most apps. Banking apps are occasionally finicky but it's workable for most people.\n<|user|>\nAny downsides?\n<|assistant|>\nPixels only, which limits hardware choice.

The effort scales with how dependent your app ecosystem is.\n<|user|>\nWhat does microG actually do?\n<|assistant|>\nIt's an open-source reimplementation of Google Play Services that fakes just enough of the API that apps which need Google in the background will run.

That artificial constraint is now gone.\n<|user|>\nDoes that mean Firefox on iPhone is now real Firefox?\n<|assistant|>\nIn the EU, yes — Firefox for iOS in EU regions uses Gecko.

I've seen it referenced but never understood it.\n<|assistant|>\nBrief version: W3C was moving too slowly and declared HTML done with HTML 4.01.

They were right, the W3C was wrong, and the web is better for it.\n<|user|>\nSo WHATWG won?\n<|assistant|>\nEffectively yes.

It was a truce that acknowledged the power reality.\n<|user|>\nIs the W3C still relevant?\n<|assistant|>\nFor standards like CSS, ARIA, and WebXR, yes — they still lead meaningful work.
