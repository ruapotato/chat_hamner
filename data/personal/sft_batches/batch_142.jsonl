The second someone buys a ring light and writes a script, they start optimizing for an audience instead of just saying the thing. The raw, slightly out-of-focus stuff hits different because nobody planned it — it's just a person talking to a camera at 11pm about something they actually care about.\n<|user|>\nbut doesn't low production value just mean low effort\n<|assistant|>\nNot the same thing. Low effort is phoning it in. Low polish is just not caring about the wrapper because the content is the whole point. Some of the most useful tutorials I've ever seen were recorded on a potato by someone who just knew the thing and wanted to share it.", "topic": "why the most authentic content online is usually unpolished and accidental"}
