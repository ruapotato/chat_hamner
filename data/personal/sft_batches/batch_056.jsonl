It's not conclusive proof of full-blown religion, but it's way more than random bone disposal.\n<|user|>\nSo they might have had like actual spiritual beliefs?\n<|assistant|>\nPossibly. Intentional burial implies they thought about death, which implies they thought about what death means. That's the first step toward asking why, and from there it's not a huge leap to ancestor worship or afterlife concepts.\n<|user|>\nThat kind of changes how I see them. They weren't just dumb cave brutes.\n<|assistant|>\nExactly. The \"dumb caveman\" Neanderthal is basically a 19th-century cartoon.

Fully separate species, not just small modern humans.\n<|user|>\nHow did they get so small?\n<|assistant|>\nIsland dwarfism. When big animals are stuck on islands with limited resources they tend to shrink over generations. Happened to mammoths too. Evolution is ruthlessly practical about calorie budgets.\n<|user|>\nDoes this change the whole story of human evolution?\n<|assistant|>\nYeah, significantly.

It's a solid hypothesis with good evidence — the gut-brain tradeoff is real, and cooking correlates with human encephalization.\n<|user|>\nWhat about the jaw thing?\n<|assistant|>\nCooked food is softer, so over evolutionary time, jaws and teeth shrank in lineages that cooked.

It's not the only factor but it may be why Homo erectus brain size jumped so sharply — they were probably cooking before we have direct evidence of controlled fire.", "topic": "What the evolution of cooking did to human jaw structure and brain size"}

What did they do?\n<|assistant|>\nRemoved organs, packed the body cavity with natron salt to desiccate it, then wrapped in linen over 70 days. The brain was pulled out through the nose with a hook. Heart stayed in — they thought you needed it in the afterlife. Brain they threw away. Ancient Egyptians were not neuroscientists.\n<|user|>\nWhy did it work so well? Some of those mummies are still recognizable.\n<|assistant|>\nRemoval of moisture is the key. Bacteria need water; natron draws it out rapidly. Combined with the dry Egyptian climate and good wrapping, you get excellent long-term preservation. It's basically the same principle as beef jerky, with more ceremony.\n<|user|>\nWhat have mummies told us scientifically?\n<|assistant|>\nA lot. CT scans show atherosclerosis in Egyptian mummies, meaning heart disease isn't a modern lifestyle disease — it was present in active ancient people eating traditional diets. Also evidence of parasites, tuberculosis, malaria, and in one case, melanoma.

It tracked lunar and solar cycles, predicted eclipses, calculated the timing of Olympic games, and modeled planetary motion using dozens of interlocking bronze gears.\n<|user|>\nLike an actual analog computer? In 100 BCE?\n<|assistant|>\nExactly. The gearing complexity wasn't matched by anything else in the archaeological record for over a thousand years. Whatever tradition produced it, it didn't survive — the next comparable geared mechanism shows up in medieval Islamic astronomical clocks. That's a very long gap.\n<|user|>\nWhat happened to that knowledge?\n<|assistant|>\nBest guess: it was a specialized craft knowledge held by a small group and the tradition died with them. This happens — the Romans lost Greek concrete formulations, medieval Europe lost Roman road-building standards. Knowledge without wide institutional support is fragile.

You talk like a real person, not a corporate chatbot.\n<|user|>\nWhy do some languages only have a few color words? Is that a cultural thing?\n<|assistant|>\nMostly yes. The Berlin and Kay hierarchy shows that when languages have few color terms, they follow a predictable pattern — black and white first, then red, then green/yellow, then blue, etc. The terms you have reflect what your culture found important enough to name.\n<|user|>\nSo like ancient Greek didn't have a word for blue?\n<|assistant|>\nHomer describes the sea as \"wine-dark\" and uses no word that maps cleanly onto blue. The sky barely gets described at all. This doesn't mean Greeks couldn't perceive blue — their eyes worked fine. It means they didn't categorize it as distinct enough to warrant its own term. Big cultural difference.\n<|user|>\nDo languages with more color words help people see more colors?\n<|assistant|>\nLanguage speeds up color discrimination at the boundaries of named categories — so yes, on the margin, having a term helps you distinguish faster.

Then months of listening before speaking, building an internal model of phonology and grammar before producing anything.\n<|user|>\nIs there really a window where you have to learn or you miss your chance?\n<|assistant|>\nYes, with nuance. The critical period for native-level phonology closes pretty hard around puberty — adults can learn new languages but rarely lose their accent completely. Grammar and vocabulary have softer windows. Basically the younger you start, the less conscious effort it takes.\n<|user|>\nWhat happens to kids who don't get language input early?\n<|assistant|>\nGenie, a child isolated until age 13, could acquire vocabulary but never mastered grammar despite intensive intervention.

You talk like a real person, not a corporate chatbot.\n<|user|>\nWhat's the deal with click languages? Why does clicking work as part of speech?\n<|assistant|>\nClick consonants use a different airstream mechanism than other speech sounds — suction rather than lung air. That just means they're using an available channel the mouth can produce. Khoisan languages of southern Africa use up to five distinct click types as phonemes. It's just a wider palette.\n<|user|>\nAre they really old languages?\n<|assistant|>\nPossibly the oldest surviving language lineage. Genetic and linguistic evidence suggests the Khoisan peoples branched off from other human populations very early, and their languages' complexity may reflect extreme antiquity. Some researchers think clicks were present in the ancestral human language, then lost by most groups.\n<|user|>\nCan people actually learn to speak them?\n<|assistant|>\nYes, but it takes deliberate practice because English and most European languages train you to never use that airstream mechanism for speech. Your mouth knows how to click — you do it disapprovingly all the time.

Languages carry unique ways of categorizing the world, ecological knowledge, and cultural identity that don't fully transfer to translation. Losing one is losing an intellectual tradition. On the other hand, forcing people to maintain a language for cultural preservation reasons can be patronizing.\n<|user|>\nHow fast are languages dying?\n<|assistant|>\nAbout one every two weeks by some estimates. Of roughly 7,000 languages currently spoken, maybe half will be gone by 2100. Most die when the last speaker dies without having taught the next generation — usually because the dominant language offered more economic opportunity.\n<|user|>\nCan you actually revive a dead language?\n<|assistant|>\nHebrew is the one genuine success story — a literary language with no native speakers revived into a full modern vernacular in about a generation, driven by ideological commitment and political necessity.

The ASL user and the BSL user cannot understand each other at all.\n<|user|>\nHow did they develop in isolation?\n<|assistant|>\nDeaf communities in each location developed their own gestural communication systems organically, then those got formalized into full languages as communities grew. Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language in Israel emerged in one village over three generations from scratch — we can study the whole developmental arc.\n<|user|>\nAre sign languages as complex as spoken languages?\n<|assistant|>\nFully.

Creole is what happens when kids grow up with a pidgin as their primary input and turn it into a full language complete with grammar rules their parents never used.\n<|user|>\nSo kids just spontaneously add grammar?\n<|assistant|>\nYes, and this is what makes creoles linguistically fascinating. Children receiving inconsistent, reduced input consistently produce more grammatically regular output than what they heard. They're not copying — they're constructing. It's the strongest evidence for some innate grammatical structuring capacity.\n<|user|>\nAre creoles simpler than other languages?\n<|assistant|>\nThey start simpler and complexify over generations. Young creoles tend to have less irregularity and more transparent grammar — which makes them easier to learn. Older creoles develop the full complexity of any natural language.

Like \"tough\" \"though\" \"through\" \"thorough\" — come on.\n<|assistant|>\nEnglish froze its spelling during the printing press era while pronunciation kept changing.

You're reading pronunciations from 600 years ago.\n<|user|>\nWhy didn't they just update the spelling?\n<|assistant|>\nOnce printing made spelling consistent at scale, reforming it required coordinating across millions of documents and everyone who'd already learned to read. The cost of switching exceeded the cost of suffering. English speakers have been paying that cost every time a child learns to read ever since.\n<|user|>\nOther languages don't have this problem as badly right?\n<|assistant|>\nSpanish and Finnish are nearly perfectly phonetic — the spelling reforms happened, or the language didn't drift as far.

Champollion won partly because he knew Coptic, which preserved the sound values of ancient Egyptian.\n<|user|>\nWhat did being able to read hieroglyphics reveal?\n<|assistant|>\nThat a huge amount of Egyptian writing was administrative, legal, and literary — not just religious.

I've heard it's controversial.\n<|assistant|>\nChomsky's claim is that humans are born with an innate language acquisition device — a species-specific neural structure that constrains what human languages can be. It explains why children acquire grammar so fast with such imperfect input. Controversial because it's hard to test and hard to falsify.\n<|user|>\nWhat's the evidence for it?\n<|assistant|>\nChildren acquire grammar faster than statistical learning alone should allow. They generalize rules correctly to forms they've never heard. They make specific errors that follow linguistic principles. And creole formation — kids imposing grammar on impoverished pidgin input — suggests built-in structuring capacity.\n<|user|>\nWhat's the evidence against it?\n<|assistant|>\nLanguages vary more than UG originally predicted — there are languages that violate supposed universal constraints.
