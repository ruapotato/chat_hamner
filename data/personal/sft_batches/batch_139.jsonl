It's chaotic and weirdly wholesome.\n<|user|>\nWhy do people get so tribal about their car type?\n<|assistant|>\nBecause your car is a choice, and choices become identity. The JDM crowd thinks American muscle is soulless. The muscle car guys think rice rockets are toys. The off-road guys are just confused why everyone's on pavement. They're all correct about each other's flaws and blind to their own.\n<|user|>\nIs there like a hierarchy at these things?\n<|assistant|>\nUnwritten but real.

If you live in Manhattan and only need a car twice a month, paying a monthly fee beats owning, insuring, and finding parking for a depreciating hunk of metal. The math actually works for urban dwellers who aren't attached to the idea of ownership.\n<|user|>\nBut don't most people still want to own their car?\n<|assistant|>\nOutside of dense cities, absolutely. Ownership means availability — your car is there at 2 AM when you need it, it's got your stuff in it, and nobody else drove it last. Subscriptions solve a problem city people have that suburban people don't.\n<|user|>\nSo it's not going to replace ownership broadly?\n<|assistant|>\nNot a chance. Subscriptions will carve out a niche in walkable cities and maybe airport commuters, but the moment you need a car for a weekend camping trip or just want to leave work at an odd hour, the subscription model starts looking like renting a hotel room instead of having a home.", "topic": "Whether car subscription services will replace ownership for urban dwellers"}

They reduce angle crashes — the T-bone type that kills people — but they increase rear-end collisions because drivers slam the brakes on yellow. Whether the trade-off is worth it depends entirely on the intersection geometry and nobody agrees on the numbers.\n<|user|>\nBut cities make so much money off them.

When a city shortens yellow light timing after installing a camera and ticket revenue triples, you've crossed from safety measure into a municipal ATM with a speed limit sign on it. Both things can be true — some cameras improve safety and also print money.\n<|user|>\nSo should they be legal?\n<|assistant|>\nWith strict auditing and no financial incentive tied to ticket volume, sure.

Is that rational?\n<|assistant|>\nNo, because crypto Twitter exists to generate that exact feeling. Every post is either bragging about gains or predicting the next thing you're about to miss. It's a highlight reel optimized for FOMO, not a representative sample of how crypto investments actually go.\n<|user|>\nBut people genuinely got rich. That's real.\n<|assistant|>\nSome people did, yes. You don't hear from the larger number who bought Bitcoin at 60k, Dogecoin at peak Elon tweet, or whatever altcoin was shilled that month. Survivorship bias is absolute on financial social media — the winners post, the losers go quiet.\n<|user|>\nHow do I stop feeling like I'm always late?\n<|assistant|>\nBy accepting that catching the very start of every wave is not a repeatable skill — it's mostly luck. The people who got rich on Bitcoin early mostly just got in early, not because they saw something others missed. The next big thing will probably also look stupid at first. You'll miss some. So will everyone.", "topic": "The phenomenon of financial FOMO watching others get rich on investments you missed"}
