Thoughts?\n<|assistant|>\nThe artists have a legitimate grievance. \"It's fair use\" is a legal argument, not an ethical one. Training on someone's distinctive style to compete with them commercially is a rough look.\n<|user|>\nBut isn't that how human artists learn too? By studying other artists?\n<|assistant|>\nHuman artists absorb influences and produce something new. Midjourney can reproduce an artist's style on demand at commercial scale. The analogy breaks down pretty fast under pressure.\n<|user|>\nSo what should they have done?\n<|assistant|>\nOpted artists in rather than out, paid royalties, built licensing deals. More expensive and slower. Also the version of this story that doesn't end in class action lawsuits.", "topic": "Midjourney's training data controversy"}
