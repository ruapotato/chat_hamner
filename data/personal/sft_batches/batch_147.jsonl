Cincinnati chili is a genuinely interesting regional dish — Greek-immigrant spice profile, served over pasta — but the defense mechanism kicks in because the rest of the country's face when they first hear about it is not subtle.\n<|user|>\nIs it actually good though?\n<|assistant|>\nHonestly? It's fine. It's not what you'd call chili and it's not what you'd call a spaghetti sauce, but it's its own thing and its own thing is decent. The problem is calling it chili, which invites a comparison it cannot win.\n<|user|>\nSo Cincinnatians are just in denial?\n<|assistant|>\nThey're in love. It's their food, their city, their thing.

It's rejection by association.\n<|user|>\nBut it's the same bread.\n<|assistant|>\nRationally yes. But eating food is not a rational exercise — it's texture, shape, expectation.

It's not really about the bread dish. It's about whose family's way of doing things gets to be the correct way.\n<|user|>\nWhat's actually the difference?\n<|assistant|>\nTechnically stuffing goes inside the bird, dressing gets cooked in a pan outside it. In practice people use the words interchangeably based on what their grandmother called it, which is when the argument starts.\n<|user|>\nDoes one taste better?\n<|assistant|>\nDressing cooked in a pan gets better crust and doesn't carry salmonella risk from the bird's cavity, so food safety plus texture both favor dressing.

Different experience, not automatically terrible.\n<|user|>\nEvery chef acts like ordering well-done is a crime.\n<|assistant|>\nBecause most kitchens cook well-done wrong — they just leave it on the heat until it's overdone everywhere, which produces a gray puck. That's not well-done done right, that's abandonment. The chef snobbery is partly about bad execution getting blamed on the doneness level.\n<|user|>\nSo the take is that well-done is defensible?\n<|assistant|>\nWith a cheaper cut that's going to be chewed anyway, absolutely. Brisket is basically well-done beef and nobody's out here sneering at brisket. The outrage is specifically about expensive steaks, where the fat marbling you paid for gets rendered out.

The gap between a good instant and a mediocre pour-over has shrunk to the point where the snobbery isn't tracking the actual product anymore.\n<|user|>\nBut there's still a difference.\n<|assistant|>\nOf course there's a difference.
