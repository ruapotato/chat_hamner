It's not the get-out-of-jail-free card TV made it look like.\n<|user|>\nBut faking it seems pretty easy.\n<|assistant|>\nPretty hard actually. Forensic psychiatrists are specifically trained to spot malingering, and juries are deeply skeptical. The real problem isn't fake insanity pleas, it's the genuine cases where severely mentally ill people get prosecuted in a system that has no idea what to do with them.\n<|user|>\nSo what's the better solution?\n<|assistant|>\nMental health courts and diversion programs for nonviolent cases.

People were convicted on testimony and circumstantial evidence that felt solid at the time and absolutely wasn't.\n<|user|>\nSome of these guys spent 30 years in prison.\n<|assistant|>\nAnd the response from prosecutors is often to fight the exoneration rather than acknowledge it.

Nixon's drug war was explicitly designed to criminalize communities the administration wanted to target — his own staff said so on tape. The medical framing existed but the political will went the other way.\n<|user|>\nBut addiction does lead to crime, so there's some logic to it.\n<|assistant|>\nAddiction leads to crime partly because prohibition made the supply chain criminal. Alcohol addicts don't rob liquor stores — they just buy the booze. The crime follows the illegality as much as the substance. Portugal decriminalized and addiction rates dropped. That experiment ran.\n<|user|>\nWhy haven't more countries followed?\n<|assistant|>\nBecause \"tough on crime\" still polls better than \"compassionate on addiction\" in most places, and politicians follow polling.

They create a safety net for kids who can't report themselves and that matters — a lot of abuse gets caught because a teacher had to call. But for adults, mandatory reporting removes the victim's control over their own situation and that can be actively harmful.\n<|user|>\nHow so?\n<|assistant|>\nA domestic violence victim who mentions the abuse to a doctor and suddenly has police showing up without her consent didn't gain protection — she lost agency at exactly the moment she's most vulnerable. Mandatory reporting can push people away from seeking help entirely.\n<|user|>\nSo it works for kids but not adults?\n<|assistant|>\nRoughly, yeah.

The Sixth Amendment guarantees it, the courts have interpreted it so loosely it's nearly meaningless, and pretrial detention can stretch for years — especially if you're too poor to post bail. The guarantee and the reality are living in different zip codes.\n<|user|>\nPeople sit in jail for years waiting for trial?\n<|assistant|>\nAll the time. Kalief Browder sat on Rikers for three years awaiting trial for allegedly stealing a backpack. Never convicted. The delay itself is the punishment in a lot of cases, and prosecutors know it — it's leverage to force plea deals from people who'd rather go home than wait to prove their innocence.\n<|user|>\nThat's insane.\n<|assistant|>\nIt is.

Maritime salvage law is ancient and genuinely weird — if you find a vessel in distress or a wreck and save it, you're entitled to a salvage award from the owner. If the owner's gone and it's been abandoned, the rules get more complicated and more interesting.\n<|user|>\nWhat counts as abandoned?\n<|assistant|>\nThat's the fun fight.

I've heard it's a disaster.\n<|assistant|>\nIt's one of the most consequential courtrooms most people will ever set foot in and it runs on chaos.

The system is set up in a way that makes bad outcomes more likely than good ones.\n<|user|>\nSo people lose their homes without a fair fight?\n<|assistant|>\nConstantly. Studies show that representation dramatically changes outcomes — tenants with lawyers win or settle favorably at much higher rates. But most jurisdictions don't provide counsel for housing cases. You have a right to a lawyer if you're facing prison. Lose your home, you're on your own.\n<|user|>\nWhy isn't this a bigger deal politically?\n<|assistant|>\nBecause the people who get hurt by it are renters — disproportionately poor, disproportionately people of color — and they don't have a lobby.

The evidence is pretty clear that representation quality matters enormously. Public defenders are often talented but catastrophically overworked — carrying 200 cases at a time when professional standards suggest 50 max.

True crime conditions you to think institutions lie, evidence gets buried, and the official story is wrong — which is sometimes true and makes for good content. But that lens applied broadly is basically conspiracy thinking with better production values.\n<|user|>\nBut true crime does expose real failures in the justice system.\n<|assistant|>\nIt does, and that's the legitimate part.

Grievance plus unfalsifiability is essentially eternal.\n<|user|>\nAnd the ones that die quickly?\n<|assistant|>\nThey make specific, falsifiable predictions. \"The election will be overturned by March\" — March comes and goes and the theory loses steam unless the goalposts move.

Once that worldview is in place, individual theories are just applications of it.\n<|user|>\nSo it's less about the content and more about the framework?\n<|assistant|>\nYeah.
