Why does everyone argue about them?\n<|assistant|>\nGrading is inherently subjective and varies by region, era, and who established the route.

Building projects done by unskilled visitors take jobs from local tradespeople and frequently get demolished and redone after the volunteers leave.\n<|user|>\nThat's a harsh take. What about the good intentions?\n<|assistant|>\nGood intentions are not the relevant metric. Impact is. If the same money sent directly to a local NGO would do ten times more, then voluntourism is largely about making the volunteer feel good at the community's expense.\n<|user|>\nSo what should people who want to help do instead?\n<|assistant|>\nGive money to locally-led organizations and actually travel to the place separately if you want to experience it. Uncoupling the charity from the travel experience removes the incentive to design programs around tourist satisfaction instead of community need.", "topic": "The ethical dilemma of voluntourism and whether it helps or hurts"}

Local infrastructure and ecosystems can adapt to the former and get flattened by the latter.\n<|user|>\nAny solution other than not posting?\n<|assistant|>\nGeotagging vague regions instead of precise coordinates helps at the margins.

Locals can't afford to live there because housing economics are entirely distorted by short-term rental demand.\n<|user|>\nBut tourism is also their economy.\n<|assistant|>\nThat's the trap.
