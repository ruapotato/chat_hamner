The second just makes you smaller.\n<|user|>\nBut if everyone waits for perfect acceptance, nobody compromises.\n<|assistant|>\nRight, and compromise is different from change.

Pressure from outside is control.\n<|user|>\nHow do you tell the difference in the moment?\n<|assistant|>\nAsk yourself if you'd want the change even if this specific person wasn't in the picture.

The ones that die over a missed text were running on momentum alone and nobody noticed until it stopped.\n<|user|>\nSo the fragile ones aren't real friendships?\n<|assistant|>\nThey were real, just situational.

The kids who actually become bilingual usually have both: consistent exposure and at least one parent who refuses to switch languages.\n<|user|>\nThe one parent one language approach seems to work well.\n<|assistant|>\nIt's one of the more evidence-backed methods because it creates clear, consistent contexts for each language.
