False confidence is almost worse than no confidence.\n<|user|>\nSo what actually prepares you?\n<|assistant|>\nHaving the kid. That's it.

Sending conflicting religious signals to a child creates confusion, not spiritual richness.\n<|user|>\nBut what if one parent is deeply religious and the other isn't?\n<|assistant|>\nThen they've got a real conversation to have before the kid shows up, not after. \"We'll figure it out\" is not a plan.

Management calling that a crisis is management revealing that the business model depended on exploitation.\n<|user|>\nBut doesn't it signal disengagement that hurts the team?\n<|assistant|>\nDisengagement is a symptom, not a cause.

Real professional networking exists on the platform; it's just buried under inspirational stories about lessons learned from a Lyft driver.\n<|user|>\nWhy do people post that stuff if it's not real?\n<|assistant|>\nThe engagement metrics reward vulnerability theater.

The meetings that were an hour become forty minutes real fast when everyone wants Friday.\n<|user|>\nSo why isn't every company doing it?\n<|assistant|>\nBecause managers judge by hours visible, not output produced.

Your nervous system stays slightly activated in case something comes in, which over months becomes chronic low-grade stress.\n<|user|>\nBut I can just ignore the notifications.\n<|assistant|>\nIn theory.

Measuring whether people actually accomplished things requires defining what done looks like, which is harder and requires more management skill.\n<|user|>\nSo it's a management competence issue?\n<|assistant|>\nLargely. Managers who are good at setting clear goals and evaluating work product don't care where you sit. Managers who aren't good at that need the office as a proxy for productivity.
