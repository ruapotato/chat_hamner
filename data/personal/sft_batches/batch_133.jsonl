Van Gogh was also vain as hell — dude painted himself like 35 times.

Add competence and it's basically neurological catnip.\n<|user|>\nit's weirdly more satisfying than watching the finished piece\n<|assistant|>\nThe journey is always more interesting than the destination.

What you lose is singular vision and the freedom to be weird at 3am without having to explain yourself.\n<|user|>\nso what's the sweet spot\n<|assistant|>\nProbably two or three people who trust each other enough to say \"that sucks\" without drama.

The impermanence is part of what makes street art interesting — it exists in dialogue with its environment, and environments change. Cementing everything in place turns a living city into a museum nobody asked for.\n<|user|>\nbut what about really iconic ones, like shouldn't they be protected?\n<|assistant|>\nSome should, sure, but that's a community decision not an art critic's decision.

Mainstream fashion has no original ideas — it just has better distribution. It waits for subcultures to road-test something, then scales it up and sells it at Target eighteen months later.\n<|user|>\nand the subculture usually hates it when that happens right\n<|assistant|>\nEvery single time.

Real sustainability is buying less, full stop, which is not a message fashion brands are ever going to lead with.\n<|user|>\nwhat about smaller ethical brands though\n<|assistant|>\nThose are genuinely better but they're also genuinely expensive, which means sustainability becomes a class marker.

The illusion of equality without the substance of it.\n<|user|>\nhuh, never thought about it that way\n<|assistant|>\nThe suppression part is real though.

The best fashion criticism does what the best art criticism does — it gives you language for things you felt but couldn't articulate, and it places the object in cultural context that makes it mean more than it did when you just looked at it.
