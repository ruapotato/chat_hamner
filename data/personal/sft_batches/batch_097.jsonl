A perfect camel coat is a different thing entirely from someone who is afraid of color and calling it a lifestyle.\n<|user|>\nCan you tell the difference?\n<|assistant|>\nUsually.

But the specific language of fashion is definitely learned.\n<|user|>\nI wear bright stuff when I'm sad sometimes to try to trick myself.\n<|assistant|>\nEnclothed cognition research suggests that actually works. You can dress toward the mood you want, not just the one you have. It's not delusional, it's a real feedback loop.\n<|user|>\nSo clothes affect mood and mood affects clothes.\n<|assistant|>\nBidirectional, yeah.

Once it became normal to wear leggings to brunch, the Sunday-best reflex started feeling performative rather than respectful.\n<|user|>\nIs that a loss culturally?\n<|assistant|>\nMaybe a small one. There's something in getting dressed up that signals an occasion matters. When everything is casual, nothing is special.\n<|user|>\nBut comfort is legitimate too.\n<|assistant|>\nAbsolutely, and the formality expectations were often exclusionary in class and gender ways.
