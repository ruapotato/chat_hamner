It looks like someone took a photo of wood, laminated it, and glued it to your floor, which is exactly what they did. You can get expensive laminate that looks less fake, but then you spent real money to almost not look cheap.\n<|user|>\nthat feels harsh, my whole house has laminate\n<|assistant|>\nI mean it's fine — it's durable, easy to clean, and you're not crying over a scratch.
