The distance shouldn't matter morally. A child dying of malaria is just as dead as one drowning in your local pond. But your brain treats them completely differently because proximity triggers empathy and distance doesn't.\n<|user|>\nSo am I a bad person for not donating everything?\n<|assistant|>\nSinger would say you're morally inconsistent, which is softer than saying bad. But his argument does imply that every dollar you spend on luxuries while kids die preventably is a choice you're making.\n<|user|>\nThat seems impossible to actually live by though.\n<|assistant|>\nIt is, and Singer himself doesn't give away everything. The real value of the argument isn't as a lifestyle guide — it's as a mirror. It shows you the gap between your stated values and your actual behavior, and that gap is worth seeing.", "topic": "What the drowning child argument says about our obligations to distant strangers"}

Behind that \"veil of ignorance,\" Rawls says you'd design a fair system because you might end up at the bottom.\n<|user|>\nSo people would suddenly care about inequality?\n<|assistant|>\nExactly. When there's a chance you could be born into poverty, suddenly social safety nets seem like a pretty good idea. It's empathy through self-interest, which is the only kind that scales.\n<|user|>\nDoes it actually work as an argument?\n<|assistant|>\nIt's one of the strongest arguments for progressive policy ever made.

You're not harming a specific person — you're creating conditions of harm. It's like poisoning a well.

That's reasonable but it's not proof.\n<|user|>\nSo solipsism is technically undefeatable?\n<|assistant|>\nLogically, yes. Practically, no sane person believes it.

Moral consideration should be about capacity for suffering, not conversation skills.\n<|user|>\nBut how would we ever know if it can suffer?\n<|assistant|>\nThat's the hard part.
