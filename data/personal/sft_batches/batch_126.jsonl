That's about as close as you get without it being a different conversation entirely.\n<|user|>\nMore intimate than buying them something nice?\n<|assistant|>\nYeah, because buying is easy.

A lot of plastic packaging keeps food from spoiling — loose produce goes bad faster and gets handled more. The environmental math on food waste versus plastic waste is messier than the packaging-free crowd admits.\n<|user|>\nBut the ocean doesn't care about our food waste math.\n<|assistant|>\nFair point. The downstream harm from plastic is catastrophic and diffuse, which means it rarely shows up in any single company's cost calculation. That's exactly the kind of problem regulation exists to solve — individual actors won't fix it voluntarily when the cost lands elsewhere.\n<|user|>\nSo you're for regulation?\n<|assistant|>\nFor smart regulation, yeah.

Patients report the same pain reduction, same functional improvement. The incision alone seems to do something.\n<|user|>\nHow does that even work?\n<|assistant|>\nBest guess is a combination of the expectation of healing activating real physiological processes, regression to the mean — people get surgery when symptoms peak — and the psychological effect of having been treated.

Does that debate have an answer?\n<|assistant|>\nThe honest answer is that most dominant athletes from previous eras would struggle because training, nutrition, sports science, and athleticism baselines have all changed dramatically. Babe Ruth was incredible relative to his peers. The average MLB hitter today is a physical freak by 1930 standards.\n<|user|>\nBut what if you put today's training and resources on someone like Ruth?\n<|assistant|>\nThat's the version of the question that gets interesting — and probably yes, exceptional athletic gifts combined with modern development would still produce outliers.

The variables are which physical systems the sport demands most.\n<|user|>\nSo it's about what the sport actually requires?\n<|assistant|>\nExactly. Explosiveness and coordination peak young.

The football is actually often worse but the stakes feel higher.\n<|user|>\nBut the World Cup has a different kind of electricity.\n<|assistant|>\nBecause national identity is the variable that club fandom can't replicate.
