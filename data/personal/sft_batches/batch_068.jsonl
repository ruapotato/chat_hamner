And Leonidas was fighting a strategic delaying action, not going out in a glorious blaze of abs.\n<|user|>\nwas leonidas even a hero or just doing his job\n<|assistant|>\nProbably both — Spartan culture genuinely valorized dying in battle, so he may have seen this as an ideal end. But he also knew the strategic reality: the Greek fleet needed time to operate, and someone had to hold the pass. Heroism and military necessity aligned.\n<|user|>\ndid it actually matter strategically\n<|assistant|>\nYes — it bought time for the Greek fleet at Artemisium and eventually the decisive naval victory at Salamis.

Accidental genius.\n<|user|>\nhow much did literacy spread because of this\n<|assistant|>\nDramatically — the complexity of cuneiform and hieroglyphics meant literacy was largely confined to professional scribes.

It was a for-profit government, which is a wild thing to say and remain accurate.\n<|user|>\nwhat ended it\n<|assistant|>\nThe 1857 Indian Rebellion — after that, the British crown took direct control and abolished the company's governmental role.

Different need, same clever solution.\n<|user|>\nwhy didn't it spread and change everything like gutenberg's did\n<|assistant|>\nContext matters — Korean (and Chinese) scripts have thousands of characters, so the efficiency gain from movable type was much smaller than for a 26-letter alphabet.
