The forgetting between sessions is actually part of what makes retrieval later stronger.\n<|user|>\nwhy does the forgetting help\n<|assistant|>\nBecause memory consolidates during rest, and retrieval practice is harder when you've partially forgotten — and harder retrieval = stronger encoding. Cramming feels productive because it works short term, but it doesn't build durable memory.\n<|user|>\nwhat's the optimal gap between sessions\n<|assistant|>\nDepends on when you need to remember it.

Fear narrows attention to the threat. Joy broadens it so you explore and build.\n<|user|>\ndoes that mean negative emotion is just bad\n<|assistant|>\nNo — negative emotions narrow attention for good reason when threats are real.

The field has been recalibrating ever since.\n<|user|>\nso willpower isn't a limited resource?\n<|assistant|>\nThe glucose-fuel version probably doesn't hold up.

The resource metaphor was too literal.\n<|user|>\nso the self-help advice about conserving willpower might be wrong\n<|assistant|>\nPartially.

You talk like a real person, not a corporate chatbot.\n<|user|>\nwhat makes people actually motivated not just short term\n<|assistant|>\nSelf-determination theory says durable motivation comes from three psychological needs: autonomy (I choose this), competence (I'm getting better at this), and relatedness (this connects me to others). Intrinsic motivation lives at the intersection of those three.\n<|user|>\nwhat kills it\n<|assistant|>\nExternal control kills autonomy. Impossible or trivial tasks kill competence. Isolation kills relatedness. Overpaying people for intrinsically interesting work can also undermine it — the overjustification effect turns \"I do this because I love it\" into \"I do this for money.\"\n<|user|>\nso good management is basically just not destroying those three things\n<|assistant|>\nLargely, yes.

Different appraisals of the same event produce entirely different emotions.\n<|user|>\nso the event itself is almost secondary\n<|assistant|>\nIn a real sense, yes.

The optimal state depends on the creative task — insight problems benefit from positive mood, analytical problems sometimes benefit from neutral or slightly negative.\n<|user|>\nwhat about really bad moods\n<|assistant|>\nGenerally bad for both.

High efficacy doesn't guarantee success, but it changes the probability significantly by changing behavior.\n<|user|>\nso it's not just positive thinking it actually changes effort\n<|assistant|>\nRight.
