A replacement is never quite the same thing.\n<|user|>\nPeople rip it out all the time though.\n<|assistant|>\nAnd they regret it almost immediately when they see what passes for door hardware at Home Depot.

When old buildings get demolished, the good stuff — original doors, transom windows, cast iron columns, hand-carved mantels — gets pulled before the wrecking ball and sold to salvage yards. It's the antique market for houses.\n<|user|>\nWhy would someone use old salvaged materials instead of new?\n<|assistant|>\nBecause the old-growth lumber in a Victorian door is denser and more dimensionally stable than anything you can buy new. Those columns and tiles were made when materials cost more and shortcuts were less available. Quality that genuinely doesn't exist anymore.\n<|user|>\nHow do you even find these places?\n<|assistant|>\nSearch \"architectural salvage\" plus your city. Most metro areas have at least one yard.
