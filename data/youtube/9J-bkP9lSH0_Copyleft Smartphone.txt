free as in freedom not free beer is a
common saying amongst the computer elite
it's an idea at the very heart of the
computer revolution that is copyleft
software a copyleft world looks very
different than what has flourished
around ios and android even though the
core of Android is open the way we make
Android handsets is not the
manufacturers often have no idea how the
drivers that empower their smartphone
actually work which is kind of scary
this force is supposed to come out with
similar specs and just about the same
Android based OS it makes you wonder
what a world would look like if those
proprietary it locked away pieces of
code got pushed out and treated like the
untrustworthy crapfest that they are
after all it's your computer you should
be able to study and understand what is
happening but you can't because
companies are worried that they won't be
able to make as much money if you can
modify your own device these companies
are protecting their IP in a way that
makes it illegal to distribute modified
copies of their driver so even if you
could be compiled a driver and add
something interesting you wouldn't be
able to share it with a community that's
in the same boat as you are with every
company defending its own IP to this
extreme we the customers suffer it
limits what we can do with the devices
we already own there's a lot that
Android phones can do that Pearson to
leave in five cannot do just yet but the
Liebherr five is liberated in a way that
has never been seen before
tourism has picked Hardware that while
not easy to use it a phone is much more
open than the alternatives for example
the leader of five uses an amx which is
a grouping of important chips like the
GPU and CPU NXP the company responsible
for the IMX is dedicated to open-source
this means NXP has to spend a lot of
time developing drivers they also have
to spend a lot of development time
getting those drivers into the mainline
version of Linux paying for all that dev
work is costly it makes NXP chips more
expensive compared to other chips with
similar specs the result of developing
in the open like this
is undeniable people passionate about
computers can use and improve
Pease drivers those same developers
would lightly feel encumbered by the
numerous proprietary barriers floating
around Android I myself cannot stand it
even using a hack to hell and back wrong
you can only get so much customization
out of Android at the end of the day an
Android smartphone is hardware running
proprietary drivers and an old heavily
modified version of Linux plus 80 cool
apps and 3 million ad written mostly
proprietary useless apps and you've got
Android elite from five is hardware
running on open drivers at least on the
main CPU and is capable of running
mainline Linux peers and is dedicated to
getting all of its changes pushed into
the projects that they are based from
where other companies would just for
clinics and use their Fork of Linux
peers and pushes their changes back into
the mainline kernel for everyone to take
advantage of instead of demanding new
apps be built for the liter 5 Pearson is
building tools to adopt the Linux
ecosystem of apps which is mostly made
up of open source software it's all
stuff made and used by the developers or
the developers and to benefit the
community of users instead of building
tooling to help spam users with ads or
pop-up chat bubbles P Rossum is enabling
you to pick your favorite toolset and go
nuts while the end user story is still
getting better
as absent features are added the
developer story is unparalleled already
let's take a look at Android the most
common programming language is Java the
other official language for Android is
dump-down Java or Clayton you can read a
low-level C or C++ program but you'll
still need to use the Android tooling
and Android UI elements which means
you'll have to write an Android specific
app it also means you'll have to write a
different app if you want to support
anything else other than Android there
are other options like unity if you want
to drop some cash but at the end of the
day you'll be writing the Android way on
an Android device let's see what it
would take to build a simple application
on Android it seems Android studio is
just about required to do anything
[Music]
you'll want to pick between Java and
kind of Java wonderful it's the simplest
example app that could come up with and
it's pointlessly opted oriented I don't
know about you but I wouldn't be
teaching oo P as a hello world example
but whatever it's Java you'll also have
to deal with some XML that describes the
UI cool you got your example code pulled
up and it's time to run here you'll need
an Android phone to test with or you can
follow these directions to set up an
emulator
finally you can test your app and start
writing some real code
now let's take a look at the Libra five
livre five developers are mostly running
in Python rust C and Vala
but the leap from five is just Desktop
Linux which is arguably one of the best
development environments around
so really the sky's the limit if you're
feeling really zesty write your own
programming language package it up and
use that there's nothing stopping you
print hello world echo hello world
display hello world program hello world
so many options here it's crazy
any good new Linux OS can act as your
development playground I write my code
in VI and K running on openSUSE which
works great for writing apps on the
leave and fun better still if you're
comfortable with the command line you
can install SSH on a labourer v to just
develop directly on the phone in a pinch
you can even write programs using the
touch keyboard Android has a set in
stone way of doing things
while the Liebherr v gives you
suggestions and challenges you to find a
better way to implement whatever you're
doing the last thing I want to talk
about today was the kind of developers
these platforms are attracting Android
is built in a way that is boring to
write code for but any developer that
can read a dock can do it since the user
base is so big it's profitable to pay
for random developers to work on
whatever app but you end up with
developers that put in the minimum
amount of effort which in turn leads to
apps that look nice but don't work quite
right the labor v is still building its
user base but it's the dream device many
passionate developers have been waiting
for because of its insane flexibility
and its policy to copyleft so they
private rack people who love writing
code while there is still lots left to
right I think the end result will be
much better than what we see in the Play
Store today
I love the idea of software written by
the community for the community because
we want to thanks for watching right
you
