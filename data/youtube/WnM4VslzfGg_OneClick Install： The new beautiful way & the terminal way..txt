installing packages on openSUSE just got
a lot prettier here's what I mean
web browser okay so I want to install T
Worlds that's just a Linux video game
that I happen to like but it could be
any package it could be a lib it could
be any Linux dependency or regular
open-source package so T worlds then I
just come here and click on the Susa
lizard icon which then goes to software
openSUSE org and does a package search
and as you can see it looks really good
now the workflow isn't really that
different but it does look nicer
one-click install open yes
next a bunch of times one password later
installation successful it really is
that easy
oh I want to install docker then I just
select get
direct install it's so pretty it's very
versatile but what is it really doing
let me show ya alright so on top this
file open with Kate and this is what the
ymp file looks like so this file is
pretty simple you've got two parts in
the repository part it just has a bunch
of definitions and summaries but most
importantly has a URL in the software
area the most important one is the name
docker so if I wanted to not use yes to
install this I could just open up a
terminal switch over to root and zipper
add repository that URL and then space
the name we want to call this so the
name is actually right here it's
openSUSE factory so boom then we would
do a zipper rough
once our repositories are refreshed we
can go ahead and and install the package
name so it's already been done on this
system with the GUI just a minute ago so
if you were paying attention I did add a
repository I already had that's kind of
a no-no I should clean that up it's
pretty easy zipper list repository and
we still don't know - - URI okay great
it's gonna be one of these that we just
added so let's grep for the URL just
this guy whoops forgot my grep we're up
okay so from this output you can see we
have two repositories the fourth
repository and the sixth repository are
duplicates honestly this one's uglier so
I'm gonna delete that one zipper remove
repository Arar and then for to be safe
I'm going to refresh my repositories and
now my computer's not screwed up
