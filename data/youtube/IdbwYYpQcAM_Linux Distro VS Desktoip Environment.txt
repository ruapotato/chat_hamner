so what is the difference between a
desktop environment and a Linux
distribution
[Music]
a desktop environment is the interface
to your Linux distribution for example
genome or gnome is a desktop environment
KDE similarly is a desktop environment
very very very popular gnome and KDE are
probably the most popular and have very
different workflows KDE you kind of used
this start bar at the bottom kind of
Windows retro style and have your
application at the bottom highly
customizable though where as known you
have kind of this side panel or sidebar
panel and you throw your mouse in the
corner every time you want to switch
applications so it's a little bit
different workflow but it's very
effective I'm gonna tase another desktop
environment this is my favorite it's
also kind of the old style menu launcher
it's very customizable one uses the gtk
stack which is just what it uses to
display its menus and stuff I three is
one of the more simple one of the more
complex simple environments style and
window manager so you use lots of
keystrokes and stuff for that one XFC
ease really performance light you can
put this on a Raspberry Pi or anything
that's like low-end and you just want it
menu to click on things so as you can
tell there's a lot of them cinnamon is
based on GT k3 just cool it's kind of
like gnome in that case but it's like
more retro style II like the matei and
Xfce guys and unity is kind of the
deprecated one from boom - you can still
use it if you're so inclined so great
there's sheilas of these but they're not
Linux distributions
no in fact you can have one distribution
install all of these on a single box
in fact my box right now has KDE
installed matei installed black box
installed and I believe xfce installed
so I have quite a few to choose from my
login manager or a display manager so
what exactly is a distribution well it's
a bundle of packages including the
desktop environment that is shipped
together for example the Susa guys they
use zipper as their package management
they let you choose between KDE and
genome in their installer or you if
you're an advanced user you can install
others as well you'll find that most
distributions are shipping with with
gnome at this point Linux Mint has their
own cinnamon but they also have flavors
flavors of their distribution which just
come with different pre-installed
desktop environments do note that you
could install any one of their flavors
and install whatever desktop environment
you want after the fact if you pay
Kubuntu you're gonna end up with a
default of gnome or you can install like
Caban - or various other flavors and
that's actually can't cross the board
you can get flavors of any major
distribution each distribution is just
doing things slightly differently
including which desktop environment is
default and how that desktop environment
comes pre-configured so I hope that
clears it up a little bit
