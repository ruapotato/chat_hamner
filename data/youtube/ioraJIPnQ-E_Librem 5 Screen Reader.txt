back when i owned a samsung galaxy note
edge i was really impressed with the
optical character recognition built into
the operating system
simply pull out the stylus click the
button and drag out a box
samsung's version of android would then
take a picture of that part of the
screen and do optical character
recognition on the image and pull out
any recognizable text
this was really handy for text
everywhere including newly taken photos
then one day after running software
updates this feature was nowhere to be
found
in any case i set out to duplicate the
optical character recognition feature
for the leapfrom five
since the lever 5 doesn't have a
built-in stylus i went with a gesture
based interface
this part of the script listens for a
three finger tab from the leaproom 5
screen
when the app detects a trigger tap it
prompts you with two options the most
important part lets you draw out a box
and run optical recognition on that part
of the screen
what this is actually doing is waiting
for you to drag out a box then taking a
screenshot and cropping it down to the
selected part
the cropped image is then fed into
tesseract and then the output is put
into the weyland clipboard
or rather it reads the selected part of
the screen the second main feature is
the clipboard reader
if you tap with three fingers then tap
once calculator
the script checks to see if anything is
highlighted and reads that if nothing is
highlighted it reads from the copy and
paste buffer
text to voice is done by selling out to
google and playing the audio files that
come back
now that this app at least kind of works
it can really come in handy if you're
not sure how to pronounce a word or if
you need to copy text out of an image
because this uses optical recognition
it's not always perfect at reading
what's on screen
but it allows you to copy from just
about anywhere well except the middle of
web pages
clearly it was a bad idea to make the
selection before taking the screenshot
to give this some sort of ui
pie game seemed like the lowest hanging
fruit to display an image in a basic
interface to drag out a selection
this is mostly the same but with a bit
of nice wrapping around it
once this is opened it takes a
screenshot then displays the screenshot
for you to select out an area
you can cancel and reselect or you can
have it run the image to text part of
the program
at any time you can also have this app
read what's in your clipboard
by default it now uses e-speak but it
can still use google voice if you
configure it some
the biggest issue is this program has no
trigger now to fix this i strip down the
original script to just a two finger tap
detector
sadly this didn't work as sometimes it
ends up thinking that every tap is a two
finger tap
fortunately looking for a three finger
tap seems to work a lot better
this is what i ended up with for a
detection script to kick off everything
automatically
this desktop file can be placed in the
right place to start everything up after
every reboot
feel free to poke around or help out on
this gpo3 project
thanks for watching bye
