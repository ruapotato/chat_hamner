the library 5 was always meant to be an
ip native phone from the start
while the focus is clearly making the
core utilities of the libra 5 work
the beginnings of what will be can
already be played with thanks to the
amazing work of oss guy on jump dot chat
this is an incredible service that
provides calling and texting over an
internet connection
just like with t-mobile or verizon
you'll get your own phone number or you
can transfer your current number without
any physical towers the closest
comparison is something like google
voice
but this brings a game-changing
difference instead of being locked into
google apis and google only tools
jump uses open standards to accomplish
the same thing
one of the open standards it utilizes is
called xmpp
for those that don't know much about
xmpp it's used for communication kind of
like messenger or snapchat
most im clients support xmpp as it's
more or less the go-to open source im
protocol
you can host your own server or send up
a number of websites and use their
servers
the labrum 5 makes xmpp messaging simple
just plop in the server
user and password and you're on your way
once you have a client connected to the
xmpp server not only can you message via
xmpp directly but you can attach the
account with a phone number using the
jump services
simply pick a phone number and enter
your xmpp server and username
if you're using a library 5 you'll get
an ion like this make sure to click the
message part
if you select the wrong part simply
refresh the jump website
with my new phone number attached people
that text me will appear like this
text with attachments like images or
videos get uploaded to the server
group messaging is also handled well the
only thing really missing here is a list
of who else the message was sent to
texting numbers is also simple add an
xmpp user with whatever phone number at
geogram.com
then send a message calling uses sip and
like xmpp
there are a lot of clients that support
sip from the few clients i've tested out
on the library 5
twinkle works the best so far the ui is
not perfect you'll have to flip the ui
to landscape or scale the screen in a
few places
these settings could probably be
improved on with just a bit of tweaking
if you miss a call you'll receive a
message over xmpp with a link to the
audio as well as a text transcription
so can a libra 5 take two phone calls at
the same time
yes yes it can one call over sip and one
call over t-mobile
not useful but cool instead of paying
for unlimited calling
texting and data why not just pay for
data and subscribe to jump.chat
paired with the library 5 this offers
very similar availability but at half
the cost of a traditional phone plan
thanks for watching bye
