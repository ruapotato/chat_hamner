so you've heard about Linux and you
might want to try installing it here's
everything you need to know to get going
so the first step is to figure out where
you're gonna install I strongly
recommend you do not install on your
primary production machine either a
separate hard drive to install on or an
entirely separate machine to install on
I do not recommend dual booting for a
beginner run on over to DistroWatch see
which distribution looks the most
appealing to you because at the end of
the day they're basically all the same
to install this is the workflow pick the
OS go to that OSS website download that
OSS ISO the ISO is the special
installation image the legacy way of
using this would be to physically burn
it to a DVD and then install from the
DVD as you may have noticed though
computers don't ship with CD drives
anymore so we put ISO images on USBs
these days and install from a USB or
what we call a live USB to create a live
USB there are a few options for those
Windows users out there I recommend you
use a piece of software called Rufus for
the Linux users out there you can use
unetbootin dd or a piece of software
called Janet and that's not the only
options but those are the ones I'm gonna
go ahead and cover real quick
Rufus it's pretty easy to download once
you download it you put your drive in
you run it you select your ISO image you
hit start select DD mode that's it
here's unetbootin make sure USB is shown
upon opening it if not you need to put a
USB in and close it reopen it select
your ISO and hit the Go button it's
pretty simple janna is a fancy command
line environment that has a bunch of
cool built-in commands to help you do
Linux tasks one of which is to create a
live USB you simply type in the path to
the ISO and type in make USB it asks you
which devices your thumb drive and it
does what it needs to do and of course
this is really just a DD command you
could literally just run this DD
demand on any distro and that'll usually
work on Windows after the drive has been
made you can pull out the drive and
you're good to go
on Linux after the drive has been
created I always recommend you type in
the sync command and you're ready to go
we have your ID USB now the next step is
to put that USB into the computer and
then tell that machine to boot from the
USB device to get to the BIOS boot
options is a little different on every
machine it could be F 6 f 8 f 9 F one
escape delete and it really depends on a
manufacturer of your machine most
computers will tell you which button to
press one it boots up if it doesn't try
F one try escape try delete and keep
your booting until you figure it out
once you do find the boot menu scroll
down to the name-brand of your USB and
hit enter and you should see a grub
screen with whatever distribution you
chose partitioning is probably the
trickiest thing to get your head around
but once you get partitioning down and
there's not much more to learn before
you can install every distribution you
want at the lowest level a hard disk is
a bunch of ones and zeros in order to
make those ones and zeros useful we have
to lay down a partition table a
partition table simply keep track of all
of the partitions on a disk and they do
this by using specific locations at the
beginning of your disk to reference
where the rest of the partitions are and
then of course you have partitions they
are the thing that holds files there are
two primary partition table types you
have MBR which is the old one and not
really needed if you have a UEFI BIOS
and you've got the new one which is
called GPT but does require a UEFI BIOS
to boot from as most bios's our UEFI at
this point I strongly recommend you use
GPT GPT allows for more than four
primary partitions which means you can
turn your physical hard disk into as
many drives as you want okay now we have
a partition table let's talk about
partition types you have fat32 which is
going to be
the one you use on small thumb drives in
Windows but it's also what you use for
UEFI boot partitions NTFS is the newer
windows file system it is better than
faculty - as it can support more than 4
gigabyte files and very large partition
sizes the extent is my recommended Linux
file system use the newest version in
this case extent for btrfs is similar to
extent except it it supports
snapshotting so you can snapshot your
filesystem break it and then revert it
back to how it was before XFS is similar
to extent and NTFS and of course there's
the swap partition type swap is cool
what it does is it uses part of your
hard disk as a virtualized Ram so if
your computer runs out of RAM it starts
using your hard disk for RAM but Ram is
way faster than your hard disk so it's
kind of like slow Ram
for a simple Linux install we're going
to use three partitions the first
partition we need is a fat32 partition
with a boot flag it needs to be about a
gig the next partition we need can be
most of the remaining disk this will be
where the OS and your home directory
will go and we'll call this one root
I recommend ext for this and the last
partition we're going to add is this
swap partition stick to around 4
gigabytes
all right so quick recap we're gonna
download an ISO put that ISO on a USB
using Rufus or unetbootin or DD then
we're gonna put that USB in a machine
get to the boot menu in the machine go
to the usb go to the Installer partition
a UEFI bios partition 8 root filesystem
and n partition swap that's the gist
alright let's download some dish gross
download a new boot ooh
downloading mint
you
downloading pop OS
downloading fedora
downloading open soos
let's install a blue to nice-looking
installer it's pretty simple you just
hit next a bunch of times well install
the third-party software because
graphics are great and everyone likes
mp3 files for partitioning you could do
automatic partitioning for basically any
distribution you want especially if
you're not afraid of losing any data on
the disk but as this is getting to know
Linux let's do manual partitioning for
everything we're going to create a new
partition table
add on here our efi partition we're
going add a one gigabyte UEFI system
partition we're going to add as big as
we want root partition for all our files
and then we're gonna add some swap with
whatever we got left
good enough
and that's that's it it installs and it
stalled cool
alright let's install mint so we put the
drive an of mint the Installer looks
more or less the same as a boon to
actually
we're going to install third party stuff
we're going to do something else for the
partitioner and add a new partition
table let's add our EFI boot partition
if I system partition excuse me let's
add our root partition and let's add our
swap partition we'll select your time
zone enter our username or password and
that's it pretty simple install all
right let's install pop Linux boot to
the thumb drive okay that installer is
not based on the Ubuntu one looks very
nice kind of reminiscent of Mac OS X
we'll go for the advanced installer oh
this is a weird partitioner it opens up
gparted for us to create the primary
partitions i'll just format things
because it's already there and Oh weird
then you select which partitions do what
I actually kind of like this it's
different than any of the other ones
looks like this is a two-stage installer
we have to reboot okay so it asks for
things like Wi-Fi and time song and user
creation cool installed let's install
Fedora there installer lets you go in
any direction you want
let's do disk partitioning select which
disk you want we'll remove things and
things back system let's add an EFI boot
partition it's at a real partition
let's add a swap partition
we'll just make all these standard we
don't need to use LBM
make sure your time and dates right and
you hit install it's pretty cool it also
has a two-stage installer where we
reboot and add our name after the after
the actual primary install cool next up
is openSUSE boot to the drive select
installation accept the User Agreement I
go to configure online repositories
because I prefer mat a let's go ahead
and select mat a partitioning we're
going to start with an existing
just delete that stuff let's create a
UEFI boot partition let's create a root
partition
and a swap partition okay cool next we
select our time zone then the username
we can make sure everything looks right
or install additional software and hit
install
all right and that's installed let's go
ahead and install VLC and all the
different distributions and see how hard
it is to get up and running all right
you know Boone - if you type in VLC in
the menu it'll drop you right off to the
Ubuntu store and let you install VLC
from there pretty convenient
Linux Mint there was no post
installation it literally just came with
the LC working so that's that's pretty
easy top OS let's go to the store in pop
OS okay and then type in VLC and install
so it's pretty similar to be a boon to
install path where you go to their store
and install VLC
Fedora
in fedora they've separated a lot of the
non-free software into a separate
repository you actually have to add this
repository in order to install VLC
and let's do Susa post-install in a
similar vein to fedora you need to add a
multimedia kodak repository as well when
you have the multimedia codec you're
gonna run into these conflicts all you
do is make sure you select vendor change
[Music]
some distributions are focused on
advanced configuration and some
distributions are focused on ease of use
but really it's it's a matter of what
you like so give a couple of try and see
what sticks
install some stuff by get out of here
begone
