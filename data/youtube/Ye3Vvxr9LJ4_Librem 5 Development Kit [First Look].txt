I managed to get my hands on the labrum
v development kit and boy does it look
great right out of the gate I noticed a
couple of interesting things first the
USB cable is purple not to be alone in
the strange colors the power brick is
orange so you get a purple USB in an
orange power brick nice the power brick
does have something interesting it can
change to various different voltages
like 12 volts or 5 volts and that's kind
of interesting I've not seen that on a
whole lot of power breaks and the next
thing that blew my mind is it's not
actually like a phone board and a libra
my board it's just one board you can
flip it over one side to screen one
sides like a bunch of things processor
eat zinc really one more on that
later
once we were satisfied gawking in it all
of the included hardware we went ahead
and plugged the device into a computer
in short order a device called TTY ACM 0
showed up we used Pico comm to connect
to this device and we were greeted with
a wonderful purism login screen I used
route route to login cat up the release
file kind of poked about a bit and it
seemed good to go from here it was time
to upgrade so we went ahead downloaded
the latest development scripts from
purism and as well we needed to install
something called you-you-you which I
guess is required for the flashing
process I wasn't able to find this in
the openSUSE repositories but I believe
it is at least in the Debian
repositories in my case I had to compile
from source and there was like three or
four library dependencies as well as
things like GCC and GCC EE C++ that
needed to be installed in order for me
to compile once compiled I linked the
file to slash user bin
switch the boot mode switch into USB and
then I rebooted the device ran the
script and it downloaded the latest
build from their Jenkins server and
flashed the device just fine after that
we switched the device back into emmc
mode and rebooted it grabbed my micro
HDMI to HDMI adapter unfortunately it
had a right bend in it which then
blocked the USB C port which powers the
device so we were stuck with serial for
the moment and needed to pick up
additional parts but from serial console
we were able to tell that it did install
the new OS so naturally we checked the
temperature and notice it's getting
really really hot once it hit up around
56 degrees we figured we should probably
wait and put a fan on this especially if
you want to do anything a little bit
more intensive on the device so we put
this on hold for the moment we need to
go ahead and get ourselves a mini HDMI
to HDMI adaptor that doesn't have a band
as well as a fan and a few other bits
and bobs anyway thanks for watching bye
