I came across an interesting post on the
pier ISM user forum this user was able
to run an Box from within the x86 64 VM
build of POS Plus Vash for those that
don't know and box is a way of running
android applications from standard gönül
innings it uses snap for isolation
although security is still
work-in-progress for an box arm 64 and
of course the desire to run android
applications on the dev kit is quite
high even I would love to run my bank
app and I'm sure others would love
what's happened some other messaging
clients I went ahead and started
researching what it would take to run an
box on a Libra 5 it looks like a lot of
work to bring an Box to arm 64 is
already done which is very good news and
I was able to find a compiled version of
and box for arm 64 so I tried installing
snap unfortunately this gave me a squash
FS error I went over to the matrix
channel and complained to the devs and
they have a pretty good idea what's
going on they enabled squash FS XE in
the kernel and all I had to do was
update my dev kit and I was able to pull
down this change the error message was
completely different this time
complaining about cgroups
freezer I was able to find this crappy
hack round which involved copying
assists FS c groups from a running
desktop and using mount - - r bind which
did work but was quite ugly and clearly
not the right solution DPA had a much
better plan to fix this and also gave me
updated kernel build directions so I
built a colonel with config C group
freezer enabled and installed it to the
dev kit with working snaps I took a stab
at installing the precompiled and box I
did manage to build an box in an armed
64 emulator but it worked less well than
the one I found here
now that an box is installed all I
needed to do is install the kernel
modules
unfortunately building the kernel
modules failed it turns out this was
because the kernel was built on my x86
64 computer which built some of the
items as x86 so that they could be used
to build the rest of the kernel I was
able to rebuild the kernel scripts on
the dev kit and the kernel modules did
compile after that but they wouldn't
load the only thing I could think to do
was build the kernel on something arm 64
like the dev kit
you
that did seem to fix the issue I can now
install the modules without issue and I
can even access an Android show
when I click on the icon I get this
pretty interface but it does eventually
air out saying session manager failed to
become ready running the session manager
from the serial connections seg faults
when you run the session manager from
within the GUI you can see it complains
about the egl and some other graphic
stuff if you leave this session manager
running in this way and box still airs
out with session manager failed to
become ready that's all the progress I
have been able to make so far on an Box
at the very least snaps will soon work
by default on the labrum 5 phone with
the community soon to receive hardware
I'm sure will have this up and running
very soon just for fun I installed a few
extra applications the usage app looks
quite beautiful it gives you a CPU
utilization graph as well as which
applications are using RAM and the most
processing power it also gives you a
simple way to track down which folders
are using up all your disk space very
handy if you're running low on space the
only critique I have is the CPU graph
itself is quite CPU intensive as soon as
you scroll down past that graph it drops
considerably as far as total power to
run the usage application not much has
changed for the update GUI but they did
add a cool reboot fade out effect also
after the reboot I did get a
notification tapping on it brought me to
an update report
very cool the disk utility app also
looks very good on a small form-factor
thanks for watching bye
