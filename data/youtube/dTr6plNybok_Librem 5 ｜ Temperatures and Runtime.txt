let's take a look at the power and heat
situation of the leave'em five here is
what the two versions look like while
charging with a small fan blowing on
them on the right we have the older
birch version of the labrum five with
the newer chestnut on the left both are
up to date and running pure OS as you
can see the chestnut is performing much
better running around five degrees
cooler than the birch even with the
birch closer to the fan a more
real-world test is charging without a
fan oh my goodness fan goes back on
let's kill this phone as soon as this
recording is done based on this test I
would not recommend charging a birch
without a fan or at least some sort of
metal surface for it to rest on to carry
away some of that heat this really shows
just how much better the chestnut
version of the Liebherr 5 is at cooling
the phone charges safely more than 10
degrees cooler than the version before
just as important as heat dissipation is
battery life without any modification
running Wi-Fi and with the modem turned
off the chestnut lasted 2 hours 20
minutes and 30 seconds this can be
extended by turning off a few CPU cores
and limiting the CPU frequency with that
done the chestnut lasted 2 hours 34
minutes and 20 seconds which gives us an
extra 13 minutes and 50 seconds of
runtime the few CPU tweaks that have
applied were the only things I could
think of to do on my own but I went over
to the matrix channel and asked what
they might do in order to save some
battery life Sebastian came back with a
few extra commands for me to try these
commands allow us to set the DRAM
governor to allow the clock speed to
drop to 25 megahertz warning this does
cause issues with the display stack at
the moment but as an extra step let's go
ahead and turn off the screen by hitting
that power button once with the CPU and
DRAM in a minimal state the chestnut
lasted three hours 41 minutes and 20
seconds which is a whopping 1 hour and
20 minutes and 50 seconds extra this
leads us to the next question can the
device keep itself cool while under load
I started stress testing the Leoben 5
and walked away for about 30 minutes
when I got back the CPU was hotter than
I liked but once I stopped the test the
CPU dropped
in temperature very fast playing with
the CPU and DRAM like we did before does
seem to be an effective way to keep the
Liebherr 5 cool this is what the Libre 5
looks like under load but with the DRAM
and CPU in a minimal state the
temperature stays between 50 and 52
degrees not too bad
this is really good news it means that
at some point the Libre 5 will be able
to manage its own temperature simply by
reducing performance the upcoming
version dogwood should have even better
cooling than what we see in chestnut we
should also keep in mind that the final
version evergreen will come with a
bigger battery than what we're testing
with today thanks for watching bye
