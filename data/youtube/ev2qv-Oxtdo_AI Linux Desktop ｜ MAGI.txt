hello and welcome today I want to
introduce you to Magi it's this open-
source desktop environment focused
around AI for Linux it's all open source
and available on my GitHub let's take a
look in the D janga puzzle that is Linux
this sits right on top of Marco and
replaces the M panels for the most part
this uses the M desktop environment
tools to open an app you'll just click
this top menu I haven't finished writing
that bit so here's a placeholder type in
the name of the app you want and just
hit enter Bang
bam if you notice at the bottom here it
says ask anything about Kate if you
select that it pops open a little menu
that allows you to have an a chat with
an llm you can just click this little
microphone in order to ask it a question
what is this app used
for send it off and we get a reply
everything from the whisper server to
the language model is fully local and it
is contact aware for contact awareness
it passes in what app is selected or if
you want something more precise you can
select something with the
mouse summarize the
selection you can also hit this button
to use ese at any point Untitled Kate
appears to be a text editor of course
this is a language model so you can just
hit this microphone and ask it questions
what's 5 Time
5 tell me a joke about
Linux the most convenient thing about it
is it's all just built in let's say you
want to type into an application come
down to this microphone and click and
hold it while you talk this is a test to
see if the voice transcription
works and it
does uh if you wanted to read it you
simply just highlight it and then click
this speaker icon this is a test to see
if the voice transcription
works not too Snappy as far as basic
desktop elements you can switch desktops
you have four of them by default but it
is
configurable um when you select
applications it changes focus on what
you're working on down here uh for the
AI and the AI is context aware and can
help you out with things like what are
basic application
or what have I selected and creating
summaries it also has the voice uh
transcription and um the ese built-in uh
by default I plan on adding in even more
AI features for now this is my desktop
environment that I use on a daily basis
so I expect to add in whatever is fun
for me it's all open source it's
available in my GitHub thanks for
watching bye
