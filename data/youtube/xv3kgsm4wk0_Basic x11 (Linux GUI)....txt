hello and welcome back everybody I'm
gonna show you how to do some cool
things with x11 while they're still
relevant yep anyway I spam escape trying
to boot this boot to VM got to my grub
screen from here I'm gonna go to eat
edit scroll then to the Linux line you
know the Linux lineup had a three I was
taught that that means booting to run
level three
um that's more or less emulated these
days and you boot - something like run
level 3 which is networking but no GUI
so if you don't want to start the GUI
putting a three here it's a good place
to put a three by the way 5 would be
default graphical one is recovery 3
non-graphical from here you can just
simply press f10 to boot so the reason
I'm booting in to run level 3 is so that
I can start x11 manually I've set myself
a root password so I can login directly
as root and the command here is simple
attacks in it you can simply run that
command by itself with no arguments and
it will start on display 0 max 11 runs
with different display numbers display 0
is default display 1 is the next one and
so on but let's say you already have an
X 11 session running on : 0 it's fairly
easy to give it a different display
number so you can do - - space : and
then whatever you want your display
number to be one would be the most
useful I think because if you already
have on running you can start another
one
I'm gonna go ahead and leave off the
arguments and start on to the default
display zero shrift day okay you should
be greeted with this fancy dancy
terminal X term that's default you can
also pass in a command to run to X in it
but this will do just fine we can start
whatever you want from here for example
I can type in Firefox and here's Firefox
notice you can't really interact with
the Firefox because it doesn't have a
window manager running and Firefox gets
kind of pissy with no window manager
Benjy doesn't have a really good one you
can start easily by itself that you can
start unity that's probably gonna change
when known comes around cool unity
running as root not a great idea but
here it is anyway
and once unity is running you can move
your windows around and do that fancy
window nonsense

you
