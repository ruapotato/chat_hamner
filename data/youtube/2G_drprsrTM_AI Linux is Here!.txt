USB that you can test out on your
computer if you've got a GTX 1080 or
better let's take a
look when you boot up your computer
you'll be greeted with this wonderful
interface and you'll see your model

of its replies read back to you

bam outside of clicking the audio button
here there's also the same icon here
which uh does a similar thing anywhere
in any
app for example I can click and hold
this voice transcription button here and
I can type in various things into this
search
box bam also similarly I can highlight
something and have it read back to me by
clicking
this speaker icon this means that you
can use a dedicated voice Dr oh well

there's also some configuration settings
you can change your panel settings and
your workspace importantly you can open
up audio settings and configure your
input
you will need working mic input for the
voice

AI model you want to use note that this
is just pulling from AMA and you can
download additional AMA models and

terminal
