hello and welcome back everybody I'm
kind of screw with Ubuntu for fun not to
do anything productive um - or / -
stress this command says remove
recursively and forcefully everything
underneath of the hard drive and away a
lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in proc and sis is not
getting deleted oh wow Wow icons
disappeared it's pretty interesting I
think our YouTube video struggling still
move things so the window manager is at
least in memory that's pretty cool oh
it's just lost its JPEG still functional
well command line returned well that's
not found huh huh huh huh ooh boom - how
well did you delete yourself let's spin
you up in a live disc Wow
a surprising amount of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is left I
was expecting a empty filesystem maybe
even a corrupted file system but there's
actually [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] left now here's the
question can you fix this
if you can apt-get install by setting a
root
I think this is probably the right way
to do it we're gonna have to download
the packages one at a time and the dpkg
install them into our really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up
don't - I have to get download - okay
look at this form it's got the answer
okay now we're gonna dpkg
install or not root - - root equals /mnt
dot slash - whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that area
is is that really the file that's
complaining about is this file if that's
the case maybe work we got to make der -
parent I know you can run that
touchscreen then maybe we can run the
dpkg got us a little bit closer and it
wants this directory so mkdir - karent
that directory tract in wants this
directory - no it wants a file so me sir
[Music]
- parent
they had a dpkg again
yeah aerozine happened but it tried it
means this ain't - clapping - go back up
here put it out / - on there okay we got
another error this is gonna take a
minute I think lube - six star dot Deb
it's a smart way to do that I think cuz
now we just have to download whatever
dependency is missing some reason that
one doesn't want to install so here's
the files that we have at the moment
um I think things are getting a bit
screwed up cuz there's not very many of
them this is what my root filesystem of
my live CD looks like okay
you could do this manually but I'm just
feeling lazy these are the files that I
want this should make all the missing
ones plus some let's do a note an LS and
hey we have directories now LS in seeing
a notice it's empty so it's more whole
than it was before
hooray put that do PKG command again
okay so things are pretty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up and
it doesn't want to install anything in
that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up mess so we're gonna go
ahead and patch a few things by CP - AR
/y live PKG gotta copy these files over
can I check make sure we got the files
copied okay yep they look right cool
so maybe the PP kg will still no no damn
dammit dammit dammit
so yeah dpkg doesn't want to install
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for us and you know what I'm done
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with it so we're gonna just copy
over we're just gonna copy the route
live CD [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] over the route CD [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and
see what happens
highlight everything and deselect whoops
dev sis and prop with control also we
don't want to copy our M and T file so
we'll deselect that as well
copy paste alright so we're going to
merge all of the folders as far as
replacing files I'm not going to cuz
it's a repair right so yeah we're gonna
go ahead and skip those okay so I
downloaded the the kernel let's try to
install it okay another package needs to
be downloaded go back to the download
download
that too how many of them are there
going to be - - force
damnit CP food fingers and then T good
the first things first as I need to do
an L o of dev discs by UID find SDA 1 so
this is the UUID of SDA one OPI se FS
tab hurry look at this syntax cuz I knew
you I D good D slash EXT for a co I
don't have an esse Cerie
just gonna go 1 1 think that should be
fine probably maybe let's try that again
remake the RAM disk ok theoretically we
have a kernel and a ram disk let's
reboot actually verify first boot well
we've got we even have a grub file we've
got ourselves in it our D and we got
ourselves kernel let's check out the
brother file in here
yeah it's not configured at all right
the grub files just screwed the hell up
I'll just do it manually so when I
restart this and we're going to
okay so here's our broken grub install
Linux boot and there it is let's try it
so it half booted we're stuck in the RAM
disk meaning it failed to boot
fully I think I'm supposed to now our
rail route under root so I'm out dev SDA
it doesn't have disk drivers really X
we've been to your ram disk utensils
suck balls if I were to do that on Susa
it would include disk drivers I think
that's kind of the idea
it could include disk trevor's without
me having to put a fudge load of options
that I don't want to figure out I wonder
what if I have Susa help out a little
bit here and we'll just use the Susa
tools to recover the rest of this
because Ubuntu's tools
okay so there's half working Lubuntu
from the RM is about to turn into
something else something else
we added openSUSE repositories to our
boon to route now we're going to try to
install zipper thanks you always trust
that repository always trust this
repository oh it's a typo okay so here
is our repositories some of them work
some of them don't
this one's broken for sure s - oops
G we add that and we'll do a refresh
hey hey hey he's downloading our new
repository all our posit orys are update
in a zipper
oh whoops
okay now we're installing the base of
Seuss on top of the boom - which is a
recovery from broken RM dash RF we're
gonna go ahead and ignore that that's
definitely a conflict from installing a
bunch of RPMs on top of a bunch of Deb's
this is stupid okay so
I'm curious to know what what operating
system it thinks it is still thinks it's
Ubuntu so that's something but right
here zipper wall and apps get on the
same system array
it still doesn't boot though so yeah
zipper
let's see if rpm works cuz apt-get
doesn't whole thing is all screwed up
alright definitely gonna ignore that
just install around the Debian system
should probably also install grub while
we're here grab the Susa version m'kay
in it Rd is the Susa command this should
make a valid in an RD we hope
how it failed I think the ramdisk
generated but it didn't zip properly
all right we're a link - ask that to the
boom - Luke location and we're going to
RM the old file ok ok
RAM disk please make yourself yeah that
did it alright so that was definitely a
weird aboon to crossover Susa issue but
it made a ram disk we now have boot in
it are these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah let's reboot
actually making big boot grub grub CFG
I've got the - OH give that a try ok
let's try that why not leave that's not
gonna work running shoe hey it booted
sort of we're in a round disk so dev SD
a hey you have SD devices great slash
routes
oh boy oh boy some more weird crossover
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm sure Ellen - soft live [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
live 64's where Susa put [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it
wants with Mount okay
our random disk is missing a library
let's reboot so we transferred the host
operating system in and RD files over to
this computer because it seems to be
incapable of generating its own but yeah
let's give it a shot why not okay man
line the next case boot VM run is - for
for its nine it's the one we're gonna
have and Rd for for nine boots
something might be wrong with my FS tab
so okay let's try this syntax instead
okay that might be valid okay well if
that works great if that doesn't work it
doesn't work
Wow okay okay so our catastrophe of
operating systems doesn't technically
boot but Grubbs installed and you can't
insure the system so I was thinking at
this point I might as well see what the
hell it looks like as an actual running
system so I'm gonna go ahead and use a
recovery method to boot this system
essentially I'm gonna boot my key : x
and qu Roden and start up the graphical
environment to see what the hell it
looks like this could be interesting I
think I'm supposed to mount our rail
route under root so mount dev SDA
okay xhose plus beautiful now we can
cure NT okay so this is our weirdest
operating system we do a cat pet sea
star re out star it's been recovered
sort of from an RM dash RF sort of there
are more files in route than there used
to be but here's the weird zipper get
yes it does have both commands one is
not functional
and look at this our desktop environment
doesn't fully work but the comp is
component and the window manager works
so I still think that's a win
it's an alt all around wing Akira
Firefox probably yep can't even run
Firefox okay well thanks for watching I
hope you had a good time I had a great
time
