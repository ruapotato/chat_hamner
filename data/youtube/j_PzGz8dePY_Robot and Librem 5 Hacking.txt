screen-capture keyboard input and a
hacky way to install stuff stick around
to the end to hear about the robot I'm
working on out of the box the Liebherr 5
has an on-screen keyboard that looks and
feels good you do have the option to
switch out the default for some
alternatives at the moment this is the
only alternative that I know about the
default is a bit better-looking
Bluetooth is also a good option to
connect a keyboard using this mini
keyboard mouse thing I'm able to enter
text in x11 windows as well as native
Weiland windows
now simpler also fills
home on the labrum five
you
let's see how many firefox tabs
five can open
okay
not bad
something that really took me by
surprise is when I press the key combo
ctrl alt f1 on a desktop computer I
would expect that to take you to the
first virtual terminal and that's
precisely what the Libra 5 did
after I was done poking around ctrl alt
f7 takes you back to the GUI session
also just like a normal Enix computer if
you want to use your desktop keyboard a
USB hub will be supported at some point
but it's not working just yet you can
however use a program called X 2x which
by default will allow you to use your
Linux computer mouse and keyboard on any
x11 app running on the libra 5
I wrote this small hack around script
that allows x2x to work with the native
Weiland windows it does need a bug fix
for x11 windows though but it does work
pretty well for most use cases after
messing around with a few screen capture
tools I managed to find one that works
on the labrum 5 it takes a few minutes
to setup but once it's done
you can record video natively on the
labor 5
you can see it does drop a few frames
when the workload is high but it does
get the point across nicely
community apps have seen an update it
now allows you to install flat hub
packages that are listed on this wiki
it's not hard to create apps for the
Leoben five and it's not hard to get on
this wiki you just need to post at this
user forum pointing everyone at your
code it's also a good idea to package is
flat pack or Deb I prefer packaging is
Deb but flat pack is well-documented and
much more popular at the moment I should
also mention the key that open repos
uses is too old for POS because of this
I force app to ignore the bad key and
install anyway this is fine for the
initial installation but it breaks
updating from the software store the
simplest solution is to remove the
offending package before you run updates
I'm also working on a free and
open-source cat toy it's a robot I'm
building with my roommate the goal here
is to entertain cats and dogs or
whatever is willing to chase a laser the
robot is built from a few parts an x86
powerhouse is used for image processing
it pulls its images from a USB webcam
this is where things get interesting the
x86 machine is also attached to a
Raspberry Pi over a serial USB
connection when the Raspberry Pi starts
up it otto runs a program called laser
control module or LCM for short its job
is to listen for commands over serial
and manage two servo motors the servo
motors take PWM frequencies as input in
turn the servos move to an angle based
on the frequency which is why I have a
pre-configured Max and min PWM value
more or less and the harder might pop
off a servo the hardware limits are
further restraint to things only in
frame by the x86 machine here are some
example commands that the controller
takes it's how much we want to change
the PWM frequency for X&amp;Y it also has a
value for how bright the laser is but
this isn't hooked up in hardware yet
this is the command the x86 computer
uses to limit the hardware restraints to
things only in camera the main program
running on the x86 machine has three
main threads this thread is spun off to
update the video this thread updates a
laser position based on an AI routine
and the main loop is processing the
video into something the AI function can
understand the AI is very simple and
needs a bit of work the pink dot is
where the software thinks the laser is
the green dot indicates the center of
movement I had it configured to use the
mouse location as extra input for the
laser this was a lot of fun to play with
but for some reason this line of code
leaked memory like mad so I ended up
disabling mouse input and added arrow
keys to move the laser around
I didn't account for the dog's tail
wagging so much it is definitely
throwing off the center of movement I
might have to toss that idea or maybe
taking longer average I know this
content is a bit different than my norm
but everything I made here is free
software and can be found in my bit
bucket thanks for watching bye
