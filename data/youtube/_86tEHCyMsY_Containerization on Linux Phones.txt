while recently learning about cube's os
i was amazed at how containerization of
apps files and workflows could add in so
much extra security if you don't know
cubezos is an os where a vm called dom0
runs a gui and can start apps from other
vms you control which vms have access to
the internet and they all have their own
files
anyway it's a cool os that uses lots of
vms just because i like messing around
with containers and graphical
environments i set out to create a
similar setup for the library 5. cubes
os uses a base os of fedora but i'll
just use pure os as a base and build on
top of that this script checks you're
running his root then runs a debian
build script this builds a debian 11
chew root and installs fosh it's then
copied to far lib container the script
finishes by setting up the system d and
spawn files with all that set up we can
start our half-baked dom zero as an app
in our normal fosh session this kind of
nesting is super cool
it seems to be using the x wayland
window to display the second fast
session
okay but the base os isn't really meant
to do anything except run vms the gui is
supposed to be run inside of dom0 while
this is kind of cheating it was pretty
simple just to edit the user bin phos
script
with a simple edit and the system ctl
command the gui is off but fock is
running from within the dom zero
container this is all that's needed to
start the foss session it does display a
mouse cursor and you have to disable
docked mode in order to get the
on-screen keyboard icon to appear still
this is really cool while this is a far
cry from the advanced cubes os dom0 it's
a start that could be built up on to add
a similar security model that cubesos
has all of this is gpl and simple code
if you have use of setting up an nspawn
container or if you need a debian build
script this is a decent project to dig
into thanks for watching bye
