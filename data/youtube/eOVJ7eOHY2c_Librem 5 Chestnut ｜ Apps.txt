hardware changes from birch to chestnut
are small but have a nice usability
improvement on the outside the two
models of the Libre 5 looked the same
but you'll notice a difference when you
plug in the leap from fives on the birch
batch it doesn't enter a charging State
when you plug it in while off at least
not automatically this is fixed in
Chestnut when I first plugged in the
chestnut it auto powered on this new
model can and does charge just fine
while in an off state the chestnut also
seems to have a bit better heat
dissipation but both devices still get
pretty hot
I've a thermal camera coming next week
that should better be able to tell if
there are improvements calling on the
Libre 5 is spotty it will work one
moment and then the next not at all but
when it does work it has a few issues
the proximity sensor doesn't lock the
screen so your face is pretty likely to
mess with the UI holding the phone like
a normal person seems to result in no
audio getting across I ended up holding
the phone like an old person in order to
get the audio to work right I'm guessing
this has something to do with the echo
reduction and should be fixable in
software this is a test of the call
audio quality on a leap and by texting
can be inconsistent but I found it to be
much more reliable than calling it
basically always works if you toggle the
hardware baseband switch the mobile-data
works really well while I'm out and
about but when I'm in my apartment
the Liebherr 5 thinks I'm attached to 4G
and even gets an IP address from
t-mobile but no data works on the phone
including Wi-Fi I have to disable mobile
data for the Wi-Fi to work stability was
also an issue when I first got the Libra
5 Chestnut I think this was because the
power status is not always reported
correctly this means that the OS might
think that a phone is charging when it
is actually unplugged and vice-versa the
auto suspend feature in conjunction with
the improper reported battery state is
causing the instability but that's just
a guess after I disable automatic
suspend the Libra 5 will work as long as
it's powered and not too hot during this
week I hadn't
time of three days but with updates
coming in as often as they do it's best
practice just to reboot daily headphones
on both the birch and chestnut only kind
of work you can get sound to play over
them but they will be accompanied with
heavy static
Bluetooth is working very well I have
struggled with Bluetooth on lots of
phones but this was the best experience
I've had so far I turned on the headset
went into settings and connected it the
hardest part was I had to remember to
switch my output device to be the
Bluetooth headset Firefox can now be
used on the labrum 5 you'll need to use
the alternative keyboard though check
out my last video for directions
you'll also need to set up an
environment variable which can be done
by editing this dot desktop file with
that done the web browser works
amazingly well the scrolling works
pretty quick and you can even watch
things like mV
phonic the audiobook player I've been
working on now it looks much better and
is even packaged as a dot Deb but this
leads me to another issue the package
war of the labrum v is somewhat
unsettled some are packaging as flat
pack while others like myself are
packaging as dot M getting your dot dab
into the Debian repository is one way to
publish for the labrum v but that is not
a simple process the labrum 5 is now
using the mainline version of Mesa which
should eventually enable 3d acceleration
for flat packs which will be a supported
way to publish at some point if you
don't want to wait for flat pack and you
don't want to work directly with Debian
developers you'll need to have your own
Debian repo which provides updates and
dependencies for your app this is where
open repos dotnet steps in I have been
working with basil to get pure OS
support added this will act as a
unofficial community app store for the
labor 5 giving developers a repo to
upload packages and whatever
dependencies they might need and
exposing a simple-to-use
store to install and update apps the
same thing was done on the Nokia my mo
tablets and phones and is being done on
sailfish OS open repos does have
existing clients but both are programmed
in C++ and QT and may include UI
elements which aren't open and need
removed so I started work on community
apps which is a simple gtk Python
interface for open repos right now I'm
the only thing in the store but I'm
hoping that will change fast if the
store did have apps this is what it
would look like this is actually the
sailfish OS apps but but it should be
pretty close to what this will look like
in the future the API calls do take a
bit of time to return which is why the
store is a bit slow a few things are
missing from the app view page I want to
add the gallery button and the comments
button next the install button doesn't
actually work at the moment due to a
signing issue but basil is working on
this I'm expecting that it will be fixed
soonish I know it's rather simple
looking but he'll it's the first verse
and it's GPL so help us all out and send
me a poll request
big thanks to Basel for doing all the
hard work here and thanks to the peers
and devs who help troubleshoot the
signature error P resume we'll need to
focus on saving every drop of power and
touching up the core phone functions the
community is now receiving hardware and
can do whatever the hell they want to
thanks for watching bye
