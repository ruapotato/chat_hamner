zelda ocarina of time is one of the most
beloved zelda games of all time hell
it's one of the most beloved games of
all time but even so it's not an
open-world game there have been many
hacks put out that have allowed you to
break the standard path which has
allowed for speedrunning and the like
but I was thinking what if I just tried
to play this game open world style and
said screw y'all I'm gonna play this
game the way I want to and go where I
want to in the order I want to so that's
kind of what I do here using two cheats
which give me the ability to go
basically anywhere on the map I'm sure
you'll understand what the cheats do by
the end of this you can find the cheat
codes down below of course this is the
standard view of this room and I'm
pretty sure there's a pot right here
it's not accessible by default but I'm
just gonna go ahead and fly off the edge
here reset this room and I'll show you
the magic pot and it's a pretty fancy
pot too because it'll give you either a
heart or a rupee if you're down the
heart it'll be a heart if you're not
it'll give you a rupee but there it is
in its full glory
gonna go ahead and pick it up and here's
a great example of the flying mechanic
that the cheats provide I have a
directional shoot forward as well as a
levitate so it basically gives me the
ability to go wherever including just to
say screw you mr. I jump right on over
his face so yeah let's check out the
dooku tree inside the great dooku tree
oh I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Derek
oh shut up
no one asked your opinion flying about
because I can gotta go get a slingshot
why not
goddamnit there's no way out of here
without a shield I'm gonna try to pop it
like an eyeball and that's a red
back to our file and I'm feeling like we
should go to Goron village which is not
that way
okey-dokey it's this way then that way
and straight gonna float over those wall
and place to screw around I'm definitely
going in there
all right let's clip out of bones it's
pretty easy here
fortunately sometimes it's pretty
bastard they difficult to clip out of
bounds but not this time
now we're gonna bounce up and down until
we get to the right place in the minimap
more or less and keep trying till we
just get the right angle and hit the
loading zone at the door got to be here
it's gotta be around here there it is
we've made it into this lock to store
not much we can do here but it's cool
that we're able to get here and I guess
that's the point let's go ahead and go
to the castle cuz why not it sounds like
fun so I'm going to okay so let's go
through this village didn't mean to do
that but that was pretty cool Oh chicken
let's see if that gives us better
dexterity in the air comparatively to
the NAP program tack somebody actually
cared about making the chicken work it's
really good I'd say it's just about as
good as breath of the wilds glider
anyway that's a small distraction back
to our goal despite it's night we can
just float right on over here pick up
the coins fall through the floor ant
load the next room okay let's beeline
over to the hole we need to crawl
through
I'm not gonna screw with the milkman
we're gonna go directly in beautiful
okay let's see what the cards are like
oh no garden here at all that's
convenient now we can screw around oh
boy mmm and we'll go on the back side
front side mmm perfect
there's our hole whoo there's another
guy
screw it I'm outta yeah okay that seemed
to work for that one too hmm
I don't like the angles on this one
let's float over it
don't lose yourself don't lose yourself
oh I saw the shadow get the shadow back
in frame there it is and landed
beautiful and we're gonna try the same
thing again
yeah I'm hard off screen I'm screwed
rip we're gonna go ahead and do this the
right way and sneak behind this guy ever
so slowly' dokey and that's our hole all
right we made it to the princess's
chambers let's check out what's behind
all of the walls first if you've got
this one it doesn't look very special
but hey let's look at it anyway
you got ourselves some ugly wallpaper
awesome well they can't all be winners
let's check out this side now this one's
pretty famous
you've got your Nintendo characters here
rather Mario characters got ourselves
the famous frog slash dinosaur depending
on who you ask
Yoshi Peach Mario Bowser and way over
there is Luigi very blurry but hey it's
cool that they had a shout-out it's a
good franchise well let's check out this
other wall this is where canons gonna
come through in just a minute
kill the gods the invisible guards Oh
aunt Isabelle from one side I guess
that's kind of interesting
well hey princess how you doing
Oh telling the water
hey it princess oh we can't talk to her
we can only attack her that's dumb well
I guess we'll talk to her like a normal
person
I mean it's less cool but what the hell
[Laughter]
[Applause]
well on that note I think we're gonna go
ahead and save quit and call it an
episode thank you all for tuning in
