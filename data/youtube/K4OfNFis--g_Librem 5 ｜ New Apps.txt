some really exciting software is making
its way over to the Libra 5 Android apps
can now be run but it's still early days
I have not found a simple way to
duplicate the setup so I don't recommend
trying just yet
but this is amazing news it means once a
pipeline is in place Android apps will
be installable on the leave room 5 I'll
report back once I can get this set up
here working local voice-to-text is now
a thing you can do on the Libra 5 big
thanks to Mozilla's deep speech and this
guy over on github i built a simple UI
that wraps around it all and helps you
set it up it can be frustrating to
download the models cuz they're very
large if this gives you any trouble I
recommend you just download them on a
computer and SCP them over to the phone
and you can extract them to this
directory with the setup out of the way
it's rather simple to use you just hit
the start button say something and then
hit the stop button this will run the
really long Mozilla deep speech command
in the background and then report back
what the text is do note that it takes
about two seconds to process one second
of audio with a two to one ratio it's
best to talk clearly and quickly it does
work pretty well it can definitely be
used to spell that tricky word or send a
small text message
it's not as accurate as Google and it
doesn't do swear words but it is usable
once translated you can edit the text
here or just copied out for you
somewhere else
Peterson has added a new default app to
the preinstalled lineup we now have a
dedicated document viewer
this will make looking at PDFs a cinch
thermals are also much more manageable
especially while you're out and about
with the screen locked the DRAM now
reduces speed and we're seeing
temperatures we needed a hack around to
achieve before a couple of channel
updates to go over I purchased myself a
4k camera and I'm testing out a few new
logos let me know what you guys think of
the one in this video but do note it's
probably going to change here in the
near future I apologize for the long
break between videos I've been very busy
getting up to speed at my new job while
I'm definitely gonna miss something
inside I'm happy to announce that I took
a job working for the morale leaders in
technology we're in other words I'm a
new technical marketer over at Pier ISM
this means peer ISM does pay me but they
don't pay for this channel and my
dedication to the truth as it stands
will not change thanks for watching bye
