hello this is janna from first show
legit your credit score has skipped to a
dangerous level
robocalls have been an issue for a long
time now with new user-empowered linux
phones on the market
i thought it was time that we had a set
of tools to fight against all these
scams
google voice lowers the number of
robotic calls by asking for the name of
the person calling
then providing that name when the call
comes in this is a good system but it
still requires user input on both sides
of the call
a better system would simply ask the
unknown caller for input to prove that
they're human
with that as my goal i set out to create
an interactive voice response system for
the libra 5.
the core of this had a few parts the
first part was finding a way to read
dtmf tones
[Music]
fortunately this is something i solved a
long time ago you can dump a bunch of
audio data to standard out
then pipe that data to socks to change
the audio format a bit if this is not a
live audio stream
pv can be used to control just how fast
standard out is
and finally we can pipe that into
multimod ng
cool so we can read dtmf codes out of a
the next step is to figure out how to
pull live audio data from a phone call
ba control and pa command are quite
helpful in finding a list of pulse audio
syncs
from there it's just a matter of getting
the right command line options
this raw audio data comes from the phone
call it's not the right rate to be read
by multimod ng so it needs to be
converted a bit with socks
this data is just what multimod ng needs
to read our dtmf codes
just like that we can see the keys the
caller has entered while in a phone call
playing audio to a phone call is not
difficult
pa play is the simplest way next up on
the to-do list is automation
for the moment i'm using this really
hacky way to auto answer a phone call
this is watching the modem directly and
sending it a command to connect at the
right time
it then also runs a script called ivr.pi
in the script i've exposed a few helpful
functions that can be used
say we'll use espeak to send audio to an
active phone call
by default it will repeat every 4
seconds but that's easy to override
dtmf will listen for a given number of
dmf codes
it will return a list once the right
number of keys have been entered
record call dumps audio into the calls
and waits for the user to enter a pound
i still need to implement ring phone but
the idea is it'll allow the phone to
ring like normal
this is where the project is today
welcome to my phone
press one if you're human press do to
leave a message
welcome to my phone press one if you're
human
press two to leave a message
press hash when you are done i'm
planning to keep this running on my
phone once ring phone is implemented
and once i solve the issue where the
feedback system gets grumpy
with multiple calls answered behind
modem manager's back
the potential here is nuts you could
easily plop together a script that asks
for a password or blocks a certain
number
you can set up a script that with the
right pin texts your gps location
or sets off an alarm anyway feel free to
contribute over on bitbucket
thanks for watching bye
