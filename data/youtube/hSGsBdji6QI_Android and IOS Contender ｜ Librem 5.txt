in today's duopoly we have Android and
iOS in this ecosystem it is pretty easy
for me to predict how your next phone
experience is going to go you buy a new
phone it's really fast and really pretty
within a year and a half of installing
updates the phone is slow and
aggravating as hell to use the problem
is phones have been really fast for
years now and a phone with a octa-core
processor running at 2.3 gigahertz has
no business being slow so you might
think what if I never install updates on
my phone will it stay faster well yeah
maybe but you also might hand your
banking details over to Bob the hacker
who stares at the CVE thread watching
for vulnerabilities to get into your
phone so not installing updates probably
a bad pick is there any way to take
control of your own phone well to some
extent and depending on the phone you
have you can install roms roms our user
modified versions of Android that are
usually much slimmer than the main
branch of Android but still can suffer
from some of the additional bloatware
being put into mainline Android this
makes installing Proms a good crutch but
not a good solution so back to how a
couple year old phone can still have an
octa-core processor and four gigs of ram
these things are computers they're just
computers with really broken operating
systems that don't have administrative
rights it should be criminal to lock out
root access from your own hardware where
the hell is the right to modify what you
buy
do we even own our own phones think
about who is selling you the devices or
who is even making the os's for the
devices Google is an ad company they
want to know everything and anything
about you and they want to know it
frequently which means your phone will
be sending location data application
usage search terms all sorts of
different statistics gathered from
random places that are all googly all in
the hopes of better providing targeted
advertisement you gotta ask yourself is
there a alternative to this
self-deprecating targeted ad calculator
well to create such a device it's gonna
take a different type of company one
who's not so much interested in money
but fundamental rights and people
fortunately such a company has existed
for a while now peer ISM has been making
freedom respecting hardware and software
for years and is now working on the
Liebherr 5 device which is a phone that
runs proper Linux not no lockdown
Android version of Linux but Linux that
you have administrative access to a
bootloader that you can write to
instructions to build your own operating
system even this is a truly open phone
from the hardware to the software to
your pocket they're not going to be
selling advertisement data that they
claimed from your GPS location they're
not going to be sending software updates
that make the phone's slower
quite the contrary in fact as time goes
on and the community builds more and
more packages around the labrum 5 the
device will in fact become more usable
and as hardware support increases in
fact faster to use more snappy more
features it's literally the opposite of
iOS or Android while this phone is set
to release this year there is a ways to
go
development kits have already shipped
and a large number of operating systems
has already started being ported to the
device including Ubuntu touch
post-market OS and of course the default
PR OS and I'll be honest I would be
shocked if this is the only three
options this just might be the first
three options in a world where your
phone is your computer and you have
administrative right what does that even
look like thanks for watching bye
