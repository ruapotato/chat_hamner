hello and welcome back everybody so
we've all had that time where we log
into our computers and the root
filesystem is freaking full well here's
a trick on how you can find which file
is using up that data command is D you d
you by itself is ugly very ugly D you -
s gives you a much cleaner output it
gives you a summary of the directory I
didn't pass in anything so it gave me a
summary of my current working directory
only I could also say asterisk and it
would give me a summary of all of the
file slash directories in my working
directory since I have no idea where I'm
looking I'm gonna start with root
everything underneath root so this by
itself is fairly useful but I'm still
not even really sure what that's in so
I'm gonna put a dash cam here so I'm
positive this isn't megabytes okay so
here we have megabytes but this is still
really ugly output I mean you can
probably muddle through this and figure
out just based on this this data here
that far is pretty big and it shouldn't
be but even so I'm gonna pipe this to
sort dash n which stands for number so
sort on the number and yeah here we can
see we have to really large directories
one is pretty normal to be this big if
I'm honest this one though this is
really abnormal var is too big so let's
modify our above command and put the bar
so D you summarized in megabytes
everything underneath bar and then sort
that so we have negligible data and far
log is full of stuff so modify the
command again and here's the culprit
thanks for watching bye
