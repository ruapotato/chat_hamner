this week we're gonna do a short
development update on the labrum 5
device me and my development buddies
picked up a USBC powered hub now this
hub is interesting you plug in the phone
charger on one side and the charge goes
through the up and also exposes USB
ports you get it all hooked together it
looks great and we're ready to boot it
up we boot it up and it's boot looping
yes we see Penguins over and over and
over but only through the USBC hub and
again crafty guy comes to my rescue
turns out we don't want the power brake
that came with the dev kit we want a
power brake that can provide 4.8 amps at
5 volts now I don't know how many people
have looked at all of their power brakes
but that's not common and so we're back
to needing go shopping again
to pick up a power brick that can
provide the needed amperage to power the
USBC hub as well as the Libra 5 dev kit
so that it might not boot loop haha some
of you are thinking well why not use the
battery as well that did not help we can
powered from the battery we can even
have the battery in while we power it
from the hub that will result in a
successful boot and a useless USB C hub
for some reason booting this way
nothing powers up over the USBC hub no
mouse no keyboard very frustrating in
addition to the power brick we're gonna
need a SIM card adapter as well it looks
like to me that my mini Sam micro Sam
whatever the hell's in most smartphones
now is gonna need one of the adapters to
make the SIM card readable anyway thanks
for watching bye
