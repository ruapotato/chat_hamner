i spent the last few weekends mixing two
of my favorite things rpg games and the
command line
while some games have a limited command
line this game has a built-in operating
system and bash as its interface
i would split it first if i wanted ascii
art or 2d graphics but i settled on 2d
graphics using pie game for now
this is the game poodlion this game is
named after my dog whose nickname falls
apart at the fact that she's not a
poodle directories in the pajillion file
system show up as rooms like bob says
you can use cd to switch which room
you're in every npc has a life file in
the game's present working directory you
can use the rm command to shoot lasers
at most npcs simply by attacking their
wi-fi
killing this enemy has unlocked a door
you can move the player around by
tapping the screen or you can set a
course with the arrow keys
[Music]
the first level takes place in depths
deeper
once you find your way over the
directories in this room are
procedurally generated
try not to get lost as you find your way
to the boss fight
much of the player's statistics are
controlled in the player's sis directory
while the user has limited access to the
sys folder the commands the player uses
can manipulate the sys files this lets
the commands edit the player's health
power or even leave on-screen messages
in-game once you defeat the first level
you'll have a new command to play around
with any file you touch starting with
frog will become an npc with the life
file you just created do note that this
takes player power to spawn in when you
first run the game it builds a chew root
of debian 11 and copies in all the game
files this way you don't have to worry
about deleting the wrong files or having
your personal data get in the way if
this sounds like a fun game give it a
download and test it out this is gpl3
and should work on most gnu linux
desktops or phones thanks for watching
bye
