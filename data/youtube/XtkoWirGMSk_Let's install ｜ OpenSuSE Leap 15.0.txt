hello Internet openSUSE leap 15 has been
released let me sell you on it
[Music]
so far it's nothing very hard man their
servers are bogged down the heads not
wedding frame Oh bitchin openSUSE 15 I
heard some good about this one I
have a very fast internet connection so
we'll have a fairly good idea of what
their servers were like under load hey
five minutes really for four point seven
gigabytes impressive so they recommend
image writer I would rather use DD
let's prepare I'm gonna use this thumb
drive small tutorial tell us the SD tap
tab gives me there's an SD a and an SD
be I'm gonna insert my thumb drive tap
tab SDC so clearly my thumb drive is dev
SDC so the command should be DD if for
input file gets tilde slash screw that
home potato downloads
what is this download openSUSE leap just
that openSUSE I have so many of these
week 15 dot ISO okay then it's just of
equals slash dev slash SD and we decided
because that's the new device when I
plugged in my thumb drive see ya don't
dad up
oh but there's more nonsense that they
want me to add equals or
megabytes dude you need a diuretic
status equals progress
and first ampersand that's a dollar sign
Dave Dave
hey cat no and and sink you know if we
all just remember to run the sink
command before we ripped out our USB
drives we would have a lot less weird
data corruption can I run this command
yet yeah it's downloaded and same thing
okay so now we just get to wait until
the ISO is written Godot key so 3.9
gigabytes copied and it ran the sink
command no it didn't but now we're
running the sink command cuz you should
ring you should you should definitely
run that sink command bro it's useful
whoa yep
geez look how much need sunk all
right now that sink has been run I'm
actually gonna reboot and install OBS
over there on this fresh install of this
okay here's the grub screen for the
Installer we'll just go down to the
installation option okay we are
initializing let's go ahead and just
spam the next key for a little bit next
I'm gonna go ahead and just go with
default KDE plasma for now you could
also go to configure online repositories
hit next a bunch of times go to custom
and you can select xfce or matei if you
so desire but for now I'm just gonna go
ahead and go to next all right so the
partitioner is gonna do btrfs by default
that's cool if you want transactional
upgrades which allows you to like roll
back and have a read read only root
filesystem but I don't even to that
expert practitioner will do with
existing disks so for me it's really
easy I'm just going to replace one of
the OSS I have on my fast drive which is
one of these with with this openSUSE so
all I'm gonna do is go in here or the
bottom here and edit and we're gonna say
do format this drive mount this drive as
root next
okay so now we're going to be using this
as my root filesystem we need to set up
s DB to be my home drive this is where
my home data is and I don't want to have
to move that around or do anything
special so we're gonna this do not
format mount slash home next except and
it's just next a bunch of times the
install went just fine
I just finished installing OBS and
adding my pac-man repos and I should
talk about the pac-man repos these are
the biggest gotcha in the openSUSE
community in my personal opinion you
forget to add these you're gonna
probably have a bad experience and talk
about how bad openSUSE is so note that
if you use openSUSE please do this next
step immediately after you install and
what is that step go to a browser type
in open Supes pac-man open Susa pac-man
just like that first link additional
repository and look here's the command
notice that it changes the priority to
90 this is very useful so go ahead and
add this I'm on 15 you were on a
different version it would have it then
run zipper refresh when it asks you if
you want to trust the repository enter a
four always and then your your system
will have a lot more packages available
and you'll have a just an easier time
playing things like mp4s
and you won't like rip your hair out
it's also sometimes useful and by
sometimes useful I mean like almost
always useful to after you add the
pac-man rabe repository to dupe from it
distribution upgrade so run this command
it's root
I guess just run this command you run
this command it'll say this package is
broken do you want to bla bla bla you
always enter one first which vendor
until it installs everything and then
you'll have a great time on openSUSE
then I just installed OBS and Here I am
so everything's working pretty good
except I'm on the open drivers let's go
ahead and switch to the Nvidia
proprietary driver because I I like
better acceleration just in general okay
so I'll be honest I was trying to do the
open Susu drivers easy way and it just
wasn't working for me so I'm gonna go
ahead and follow the hard directions
which is Nvidia the hard way it's easy
you just Google and do the hard way with
Syria so it's the first link now we're
gonna go ahead and give these commands
or run install some patterns go for it
and this is gonna install like the
source code for my kernel and
development crap needed to compile the
kernel driver that will come with the
Nvidia installer so while that's going
we're gonna go ahead and keep reading
these download the driver
okay let's download the driver
mine's a Geforce 1060 GeForce GTX 1060
for the Linux 64-bit operating system
English yes looks like this is the right
one for me
download save file ok so now we have the
Nvidia driver it's just a matter of
getting the right dependencies installed
and dot slashing that file with no GUI
running oh yeah we need to do it without
this so we're going to open them yost
yes boot loader all right this is the
bootloader config we can add kernel
parameters in here this one okay
so we're gonna add that option right
here just like so okay it's gonna go
ahead and regenerate my integer RT looks
like we're fairly well installed here
and I'm gonna go ahead and reboot to run
level 3 ok post reboot I did for the
source node the sympathies was installed
at the right version so I updated my
kernel as well with zipper top and then
it was simple dot slash the Installer I
had it regenerate my X config files and
it worked really well it's running right
now pretty anyway I hope you enjoyed
openSUSE it's a great operating system
there's a couple pickups you have to
like know about if Dad pac-man
depository and sometimes adding the
proprietary drivers a bit tricky but
overall I think you'll have a great time
thanks for watching
