it's a good idea to keep your valuables
safe and your phone is no different
let's go over how i slap together a
libra 5 case
when it comes to 3d printing multiple
iterations are just about always needed
this is my first attempt to make a lever
5 case it's too small
not very thick and the holes are in the
wrong place clearly i would need to make
a few adjustments
in blender i ended up applying the
solidify modifier to add thickness to
the case
this worked well except that it added a
triangle artifact the solution was to
apply the solidify modifier then select
the top faces around the issue
and then scale the z-axis to zero more
fine adjustments and it was time to add
a top lip
as bit worried about adding the lip
without support material but it seems to
have printed okay without it
with the case designed and working on
the dogwood release i expect this to be
completely trivial to update for the
evergreen mass production run
as a bonus the skills i learned in this
project let me print a perfectly usable
replacement toilet handle
for those looking to get into 3d
printing with open source software head
on over to the 3d printing professor
part of animation here's a fantastic
tutorial on how to set up blender 2.8
for 3d printing
has a powerful set of tools for doing
that
phonic the audiobook player i've been
building for mobile linux has seen a lot
of bug fixes
to name a few chapter skipping bugs have
been resolved and moving the audiobook's
location no longer breaks the bookmarks
i also added in a few new features the
chapter names are now displayed
and i've added in a basic sleep timer to
auto pause the player after so many
minutes
the latest version is available on my
bitbucket as a dot dev contributions as
code or feedback are more than welcome
and since the dot dev just contains
python this should run on just about any
debian or ubuntu-based system
including across architectures like arm
and x86
head on over to hackers-game to find out
more thanks for watching bye
