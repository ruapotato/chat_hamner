in March 2018 peer ISM announced the
initial support for plasma mobile on
their Libre m-- imx6 test boards the
predecessor to the dev kit as many of
you know the Libra 5 will work with two
options for your desktop environment you
have the genome based phone shell or
Fache for short and plasma mobile if
you're feeling crazy and want to run
your desktop UI on your phone it's not
difficult and you can see my last video
on what it looks like today and of
course whatever the community decides is
important we'll also get ported to this
device here is what plasma mobile used
to look like running on the imx6 test
board first off the icons are rather
small and the graphics are kind of
jittery and slow however the biggest
issue is the cursor is outright missing
this is forcing the developer to hold
ctrl and super which draws that little
rotating circle around the missing Mouse
kind of a funny hack workaround that is
no longer needed here is the built-in
chess application it seems to work fine
hmm
but a little bit slow now that we've
seen it run on the old iMac 6 test board
let's go ahead and put the latest image
on the dev kit and see what improvements
have been made step 2 we need to resize
the root filesystem a little bit of repo
magic modify a couple system files and
reboot thank goodness they had good
documentation the first thing that
strikes me is the icons are now too
large and overlap slightly I'd still
argue that's better than too small the
KDE calendar app does seem to work just
fine but the color scheme does kind of
make it hard to see and washed out on
the recording so my apologies the
built-in chess app works so much better
on this latest build just as a direct
comparison you can see how many frames
there are before and how many frames are
now it is noticeably smoother as you
move the characters around the board you
can slide from the bottom of the screen
or hit the left-hand squared to bring up
after from here you can close or select
which application you want in focus they
also have the classic KDE widgets that
you can add and this just gets put right
in the space above your app drawer clock
widget works great not really doing much
but being there the system tray widget
works fine as well showing off available
disk space and presumably showing off
other notifications as well like most
standard smartphones a slide from the
top will bring up the notifications and
quick system settings you can get a
pretty good idea of what this is gonna
be like to use on a daily basis you can
easily turn off your wireless you can
modify your sound your location or if
you just need a quick flashlight the
notifications area does work here's a
crash report and I'm assuming things
like text messages and voicemails and
things of that nature will also end up
in the notification area the file
manager is not optimized the icons are
teeny and very tiny alright great so if
you're looking forward to using KDE
plasma mobile it's looking pretty
promising there have been some pretty
large improvements specifically to the
graphic stack let's talk about gaming
while purism has said they will be
working on the basic features of the
device like calling and texting in the
base browser they have not said they
were gonna be working on any games at
all for the device so I've decided to
test three different open-source games
and see where they are at the moment
with no human effort to make them
actually run on the dev kit I installed
mine test a minecraft clone T worlds and
super tux cart starting with mine test
it installs just fine but the icon
doesn't show up in Fache running it from
command line and Fache doesn't work
either in yielding just a black screen
but if you run it in KDE plasma mobile
tada it runs just fine ish kind of I'm
amazed at this point that I've never
figured out how to open a keyboard in
KDE plasma mobile if somebody knows how
to open a keyboard let me know cuz this
was kind of a big issue as I'm not sure
how to open the on-screen keyboard
I used X due tool in order to input a
world name but after inputting a world
name I was able to click create world
and see a wonderful green bar load up it
didn't do anything past that unless you
count crashing the entire device as
something T worlds does seem to load
fine in all of the different desktop
environments however in Fache once again
the icon was missing and I had to use a
terminal to launch the application the
biggest issue with T worlds was the
input and the resolution so this is the
best candidate for low-hanging fruit in
my opinion especially if you want to
plug in a mouse and keyboard but like
super tux cart was an utter fail post
install I know desktop environment with
load so reflash the fact that some open
source games even partially work is
amazing all in all not a bad improvement
thanks for watching bye
