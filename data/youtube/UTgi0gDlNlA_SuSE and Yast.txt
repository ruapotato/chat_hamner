so yes tis getting a lot of kind of
sick of it it's a powerful tool if you
know how to use it and more importantly
when to use it
[Music]
first off we've got our software
repositories this is wonderful please
don't remove this tool you can hit add
community repository and here you can
add your nvidia driver repository your
pac-man repository which if you don't
know is incredibly useful I've added it
through other means so it doesn't show
up here but you can absolutely add it
through here I wouldn't say it's ugly or
bad another time to use you asses if you
want to install patterns or search for
patterns so software management you can
search for packages in here but I mean
that's a good way to find like one-off
packages but not big packages like matei
if you want that go go to view patterns
once you're in here you can go ahead and
just select which desktop environment
she wants if I wanted to install KDE
plasma 5 I would select this and it
would go ahead and select a shitload of
packages for me then I go to accept and
I'm done or of course you can do the one
off by going to search and then let's
say I wanted to install is on top of
everything which I've clearly already
done but yeah you can just select things
in here it's oddly reminiscent of the
synaptic package manager' back in the
aboon two days so honestly I can't give
it any this is a very robust
graphical interface to your repositories
however I just use it for most of the
time another really useful tool is the
boot loader this works really well in a
two route if you break your system and
in fact I would definitely not recommend
taking this out of the system it's a
powerful tool that I wish RedHat would
have something like rather than just a
command-line install grub which works
most of the time but this will
regenerate all the config files for me
as well as install grub so if I have a
broken grub I would chew root my system
come into here and
just just hit okay and it's gonna just
gonna configure my bootloader for me
that's beautiful that's useful it also
has an okay partition er um it's like
the Installer partitioner it'll get the
job done but G part it's better the sis
config editor might be a little bit
weird if you're not used to Susa but it
is actually really useful so yeah sis
config this is where you can change
things like your display manager your
window manager see what I'm using light
DM okay if the other day it's just an
easy way to set up your config for su
say another time this can be useful is
if you want to set up a file share I
mean you can do that with config files
and yes it will overwrite config files
if you configure it manually and then
try to use yes that would be a bad plan
but hey it makes things simple if you
don't want to dick around in a config
file forever so a lot of people say it's
ugly that's kind of true it's really
ugly in a terminal but what and curses
application isn't a little ugly so when
you first open yes in a terminal this is
what you're greeted with it's actually
pretty easy to navigate and you can do
all the same things you can do with the
graphical version with the end curses
version so arrow keys to navigate tab to
switch between areas shift tab to go the
opposite direction to any area so this
goes back where shift tap goes backwards
tab goes forwards backwards forwards and
it all just loops around so tab to the
area you want then select down to
whatever let's say I want to do some
software management I've got a software
management software management alright
from here if I wanted to go to patterns
I would hit shift tab
and that takes me to the filter down
arrow lets me select in this menu and I
just simply arrow up to patterns enter
and then I select whatever I want if I
wanted to install and Lichtman I could I
just hit enter on that and that and then
I could hit tab a bunch of times all the
way to accept and hit enter that's valid
but notice that some of the menu items
have a yellow letter like this one and
this one this one if you hold down the
Alt key and then press whatever a key is
in yellow it will trigger that so alt a
auto selects the accept and if I do alt
oh it auto selects okay but I don't want
to so I'm going to alt see this and then
I'll see again and then all T Y so as
you can see it's actually pretty
intuitive and easy once you know what
you're doing when not to use last well
honestly yes will get in the way more
often than not if you're just installing
simple things so if you can get away
with just using zipper on the command
line you should if you really want to
probe around your repositories or if you
want to add a community repository or
install an application that's part of a
larger package group then yes tis
definitely the thing you're gonna want
to use and if you're wrong
upon its watching
