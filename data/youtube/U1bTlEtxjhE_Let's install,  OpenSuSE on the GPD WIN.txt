how to install and configure openSUSE
for the GPD win or rather the GPD then
maybe not anyway you need a pretty large
USB Drive recommend at least eight
gigabytes x86 alright just have to let
this download let's open the image
writer
so I'm gonna install my thumb drive in
my main computer it was automatically
detected my 8 gigabyte thumb drive and
we've selected the latest snapshot go
ahead and write that it will destroy any
data on the thumb drive it just will
post word now we just wait for this
magic box to complete now's a good time
to shout out to the guy who did actually
most of the work and did like all the
kernel coding and whatnot
this guy's a badass just saying I've
compiled his kernel and I'll link to
where you can download the RPM it is
ideal if you downgrade your bios in
Windows before you do this if you didn't
you'll still be ok but it is ideal if
you do because there's a couple BIOS
changes that we can change if we have an
older BIOS and it's actually pretty easy
to install this older BIOS I'll link to
the zip folder all you do is in Windows
extract the zip folder double-click the
batch file and it just installs the BIOS
and it's pretty easy
I have heard there's a way to install a
BIOS in Linux I've never done that and I
will never do that because I'm already
on the write BIOS so good luck with that
our image is done writing go ahead and
pull out my thumb drive and insert it
into the back of my GPU with all right
let's spam delete
oh boy notice their BIOS is like weirdly
sideways it's okay it's not too hard to
use if you don't have this many options
you have the wrong BIOS or rather the
less ideal BIOS but if you install this
kernel you'll still be okay
I've changed my boot option to the UEFI
USB disk so theoretically that's gonna
allow me to go to the USB device now
save and exit save changing settings so
let's boot it up expecting it to use the
USB device great it detected it I hit
down arrow really quick there so that it
wouldn't continue booting into the
Installer I'm gonna hit eetu edit this
and scroll down to my Linux line at the
end of my Linux line I'm going to append
this argument and this argument with a
space in between so I'll do that now
once that's typed in I'm gonna hold down
the thing key and 0 which will be f10
and that'll boot me into my system if
you have a USB hub and could be booting
from a USB hub and you can put a USB
mouse in or if you could plug into a
HDMI monitor you're way better off then
I'm about to be because I'm gonna have
to use a joystick that's that up is not
up and it's rotated 90 degrees
because the contest of how well can you
install using a 90 degree rotated Mouse
I'm just gonna go to next all the way to
the partitioner screen
I feel adventurous so I'm gonna go to
expert partitioner you can partition it
however you want but so I went with a
really simple partition scheme here I
have a half gig fat32 partition very
beginning for my EFI boot then I have a
4 gigabyte swap partition and then I
have the rest allocated for my Roo
partition make sure that you have boo-ki
fi set for your mount point for the
fat32 filesystem the rest of this is
going to be pretty standard I'm gonna
install with gnome but I'm gonna install
mattei after I'm done I just prefer
matei at the end of the day and now we
just wait for it to install let's get
another thumb drive or you can
repartition your old thumb drive we're
done with it now and copy over the
wireless config file alright so we've
got the file copied over to our thumb
drive go ahead and eject this I'm going
to open a terminal CD to my drive so CP
your local copy slash firmware BR CM
permission denied yeah okay sudo once
that file has been copied over go ahead
and reboot and you should have wireless
connectivity so if you're still having
wireless issues it could be because of
this BIOS bug it can be worked around if
you have this older version of the BIOS
just by going to this chipset
Southbridge etc etc and setting it to
disabled I recommend that you do this if
you have the ability to alright so this
is just iceweasel I'm just gonna use
this temporarily to install Mattei so
then I'm just gonna go to software
management go to view patterns and
mattei and then accept and wait for your
matei packages to install and i have an
Matei option now all right so now we
have Mattei installed a couple things
are messed up one the screen is sideways
but we can use the touchscreen while
it's sideways that will cause a bug once
we rotate the display so I'll go ahead
and rotate this plane now just by going
to the menu typing a display just blue
settings right all right so now the
things are rotated right I'll keep this
configuration Oh
touchscreen is no longer working all
right
another thing that drives me crazy is
the mouse
I feel like setting this to left-handed
Mouse makes more sense that way you can
control your computer with this most of
the times if I want to go to folders I
can
etc etc rather than having to use two
hands to control the device always I
have a fancy script I'll put on my
website settle rotate the touch input so
it's no longer off like this already got
a copy of it on here touch write down SH
execute that and your touch input should
be aligned something to know is it's
hard-coded to expect that you booted
with this mouse option in the middle not
in gamepad mode if you were in gamepad
mode this touch script would need to be
slightly different so Mickey use this
script just make sure you boot with the
mouse mouse pad mode or you'll be
confused why doesn't work now let's go
to my website and download those kernel
rpms all right it might not look like
this considering there's not much here
but I'm gonna go ahead and download my
rpms that I need I have all the kernel
packages downloaded I'm gonna go ahead
and
pseudo zipper in dot slash colonel
asterisk all right now that the kernel
is installed let's go into yeah so yes
then we want the bootloader in the
bootloader can fit in our kernel
parameters whatever you have in here
just append the same things we've been
appending so this command line or this
kernel option and this kernel option as
well as the DMI product name equals GPD
win all right so a couple things we need
to do here hit ye and then scroll down
to your Linux line again so it should
say something like lineage EFI boot VM
lineage and then a bunch of options if
you don't have the GPD win plus the end
then it's it's not the right colonel you
need to specify which colonel in your
your grub config file assuming that that
did work and your command-line options
are in that mess of options you can
select f10 again to boot alright so
another thing that I had to do in order
to get the headphone jack working
properly
I had to blacklist this HDMI audio
assuming you're not going to need to
have sound through HDMI your headphone
jack just won't work right unless you do
this so let's go ahead and edit this
file on my GPD win and add this line ok
nothing too fancy I'm gonna go ahead and
reboot again so my touch screen is still
off aligned every time I restart that's
a easy fix I'm just gonna add that
script to my startup config so in here
startup startup applications then add
I'll type in the name of fix
and then command I'm going to go to
browse select they touch right Sh script
which will be on my website make sure
that it has execute permissions so it
can run as a program hit ok add close
and let's restart again ctrl backspace
just restarts your x11 session so
that'll allow me to log in without
having to reboot entirely hooray things
are working touchscreens working
Internet's working sound is working
Firefox is working thanks for watching
