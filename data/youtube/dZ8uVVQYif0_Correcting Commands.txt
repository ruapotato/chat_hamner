if this hasn't scared you away yet then
I've got some useful tricks for you to
correct those mistyped commands
[Music]
so let's say you type in something
that's supposed to be pseudo but it's
not pseudo you can go ahead and put a
carrot the long coat onco thing and the
right thing so that's a search and
replace as in search for replace and
specifically the last run command ok
great you get how that works
now let's say you did the exact same
damn thing but you don't want to have to
type that in because who wants to
practice a muscle memory for that nobody
does so the right answer is pseudo and
an exclamation mark and a star that says
run sudo with the arguments of the
previous command previous command
arguments of the previous command ok but
there's actually a lot of these like
exclamation mark and then symbol things
I'm gonna go ahead and show you all of
those but do that I'm not going to show
you all of those I'm gonna show you some
of them geez there's a lot of them umm
echo AVCHD if you want the first element
we can do exclamation mark and then a
character that's the element a if we
want the last one is its echo
exclamation mark and a dollar sign okay
if we want the third element the syntax
is echo exclamation mark colon three and
do note that's not zero-based it's
literally going to be the third element
and that's because there is no third
element so it's rerun this and then
rerun
parent :
the third okay last example and it's
probably the best one or maybe most
useful ones so if you remember any of
these just carry this out with you let's
let's pretend you're looking for a final
oh there's those jar files you want a CD
to this directory now you don't have to
re-type out that path that's silly and
you don't have to like Barrow control a
delete Eevee I mean you can control a
over there and do that but I would
recommend that you just type in CD and
then you hold the alt or the escape key
and hit period that will do a very
similar thing to have the exclamation
mark dollar sign behaved in our previous
example now but you can continue to
press a note toggle through more of the
arguments it's very useful and should
save you a lot of typing thanks for
watching bye
you
