computers send and receive data all
around the world but just how does that
work let's dive in
let's start with two computers computer
a and computer b cable together with an
ethernet cable
the ethernet cable itself is just a long
run of wires
it connects to the computer with a
network interface controller most
commonly referred to as a nic
most computers come with a built-in nick
but you can add in an extra if you have
available pci lanes
nics come with a completely unique id
called a mac address
and the mac address is similar to a
shipping address but for your neck
usually you only have one mac address in
used by the computer but if you have
multiple network interfaces like wi-fi
and ethernet a second mac address could
be in use
the nic itself is able to make and
receive signals across the ethernet
cable
keep in mind this is just a cable where
sending down electricity in a specific
way
sending electricity down a line for some
amount of time could indicate a one
while the absence of electricity could
indicate a zero
here's an example computer a sends eight
ones or zeros indicating a letter of the
alphabet
computer b responds back with a message
if the letter was received correctly
or responds with a different message if
the letter needs repeated due to an
error
what we have defined here is a super
basic protocol in reality your nic
receives something called frames but in
a similar light it has its own protocol
defining the meaning in order of the
ones and zeros
we won't dig in this too much today but
your neck card sends small chunks of
data over a frame
similar to a shipping label the frame
has a destination mac and a source mac
when a frame is received by your neck it
checks to see if the destination mac
matches your unique id
if it does the data is processed by your
computer to the user this process data
could look like a web browser loading a
bit or a download continuing however
these processes could take thousands of
frames to complete
using macs to address computers works
perfectly well if all the computers are
directly attached
but the internet is made up of a bunch
of smaller networks that can all talk to
one another
computer applications also don't use mac
addresses to directly transfer data
between each other and said
ip addresses are used when a net card
receives a frame the data inside usually
contains something called a packet
similar to the frame protocol the ip
protocol defines the order and meaning
of the raw ones and zeros coming across
the ethernet
these packets contain a source and a
destination ip as well as a data payload
normally each computer has one ip
address but each nic attached to a dhcp
server will be assigned an ip
this is done by the router in most home
networks if computer a wants to talk to
computer b
but computer a only knows the ip address
of computer b computer a can use
our address resolution protocol to
resolve the destination mac
this is where a frame is sent to all
computers on the network the computer
with the matching mac
replies back while all other computers
ignore the request
most home networks use an ip range of
192 168
1 something and have a subnet mask of
255 255 255
0 which is often referred to as a slash
24 network
let's look at one of these ips in this
example all ips in your network will
start with 192 168 1 something
dot 11 is unique to this computer on
this network slash 24 is the subnet mask
the subnet mask more or less defines
which part of the ip is common to your
network and which part changes per
computer
in this example all ips starting with
192 1681 are part of your network
any ip outside that range needs your
router to forward your packet to the
proper router
if your running table is set up
correctly then the next hop or router
should be able to resolve the ip into a
local mac address
or at least be able to forward it on to
a router that can there could be any
number of these network hops in between
you and just about anywhere on the
internet
of course we don't type in ip addresses
to our favorite websites
even though we can instead we rely on
dns servers
if you send a dns server a domain name
it will reply back with the ip address
tied to the domain name
this lets anyone set up a web server
then pay for a domain name
next they can point that domain name at
that ip address people that browse to
the site will end up talking to a dns
server to find your ip
then your data will be hopped across
various routers to its end destination
at this point computers can route data
to various networks using the ip
protocol
the data in the ip packet usually
contain something like tcp
which is short for transmission control
protocol these protocols often have air
correction built in
these tcp packets are the basis of how a
lot of fundamental applications work
including http and https which is how
web pages send and receive data
