hello and welcome back everybody so I
ran into an issue I need to upgrade my
system to
openSUSE tumbleweed in order to try out
the Weiland stuff and I desperately want
to try out the Weiland stuff so
upgrading they've made this beautiful
duck you can see the link down below
we're really just gonna follow this doc
procedure goes pretty simply you can
download the DVD and do a down server
upgrade I strongly recommend you do this
offline style it's it's safer it's
better it's easier you literally just
follow these steps but we're gonna do an
online upgrade which is more dangerous
and there's more things that can go
wrong especially if you're trying to use
x11 to record it x11 can crash during
this and if x11 is running your upgrade
well that sucks
but we're gonna risk it I think we'll be
okay here's my current repositories it's
gonna have me just copy all of these
into it back backup directory and add
the new ones on top of it you could also
modify these but that's a lot more work
and I'm just gonna go with its
recommended way of doing it okay step 1
make that directory and the Etsy od2
Etsy zip repos Dee old so that's that's
just copying all of a repository data
into a backup directory if we do an LL
on these repos Dee old yeah we see a
bunch of
hooray successfully backed up also if we
do a zipper list repositories no
repositories to find but that's not a
big problem we're about to define them
all let's do this one time make sure
that
they run properly execute and this one
added this one
okay so we've run all the ad repository
things we're gonna go ahead and do the
recommended optional bit here - lets do
a zipper list repositories - - you are I
on a bigger screen than that we'll
compare that to this output four and
five being to say bolt yep yep looks
good to me
OBS has some useful documentation to add
pac-man here - see look at this
there's my pac-man repository and it
sets the priority for me thank you very
much
so we're gonna add the pac-man one as
well notice that it's a priority is
lower than the other priorities that
means that packages are gonna come from
here before anywhere else and that's a
good thing it'll make that'll make VLC
work right as well as my other
multimedia packages it's good to do that
alright here's the warning it's telling
me that I should not do this on an X 11
screen I should definitely not be
recording it I'm going to do it anyway I
think it's fine zipper doop let's see
how this goes all right there okay so
reading us pretty carefully it's trying
to install the new version of this
package and one of my options is to D
install the previous version of the
package so I'm gonna go with that option
or place it okay that seemed to fix all
of
package issues it's gonna cost me not
that much it's really not gonna cost me
that much go for it
cute quit yes to continue
cute quit yes to continue I didn't read
those alright so it looks like it has
completed successfully it's telling me a
bunch of is loaded Ram it needs to
be reloaded so it's time to reboot okay
so it didn't quite work my graphics
drivers were clearly broken when I
rebooted I didn't get a graphical
environment I logged into the
non-graphical terminal and went into
YaST then software management I hit
shift tab to go up to filter down arrow
to get to this menu arrow up to go to
repositories great then select Nvidia
then I just marked these for removal a
lot of things will complain break things
you don't want to uninstall anything
else because we're gonna immediately
reinstall these again then I had except
I uninstall this stuff then you come
back in here and you simply reinstall
these same ones you hit except it'll
reinstall your graphics drivers I
rebooted and everything came up really
well to prove that here we go here's a
cat of my Etsy release file and as you
can see we were running temple bead
thanks for watching
