like a new linux file system and other
unix-like file systems can be thought of
as a hierarchy of directories starting
at slash which is usually referred to as
root
for this example files in a directory
show up as squares with the height based
on the file size
i find it helpful to think of a
directory as a location or room
every directory in our current location
shows up as a hallway leading to its own
room
building this structure we can show off
the gnu linux file system in 3d space
here at the start or route we have
several essential directories and we'll
go over them one at a time but before
that let's talk about your current
working directory
when navigating the command line your
console will have a location just like i
have a location walking around this 3d
file system
right now my current working directory
is slash or root
as we move around this virtual file
system i'll show you the relevant
commands needed to navigate the command
line as well
to view your current working directory
run pwd in modern linux this stands for
print current working directory
while originally in unix this command
was read as present working directory
both mean and do the same thing your
current working directory is also often
shown in your command line prompt
now that we know the command line has a
working directory location let's go over
what lives in root
the boot directory contains all the
files necessary for your computer to
start up
in most cases this means a grub config
file and some uefi stuff
walking down hallways or changing
directories is done with the cd command
from the shell
to use this run cd space a directory
name that's in your current directory
this will change your location to the
specified directory if you're feeling
really zesty
cd space dot slash the directory name
the dot slash in the previous command
means from where i am right now remember
where you are right now can be viewed
with a pwd command
when you want to go back a directory or
in this case a room the command can be
done relatively which means from where i
am right now or i can be done absolutely
which means relative to root
absolute paths are also sometimes called
the full name
to get back to root with a relative path
the command is cd space dot dot slash
dot dot slash dot dot slash
each dot dot slash means back one
directory for my pwd
the absolute way to get back to root is
always cd space slash
if you want to change directory to the
boot file with an absolute path the
command would be cd space slash boot
all absolute paths or full names start
with a slash and work their way down
from here on out i'll show you the
absolute path and the relative paths for
each command
hopefully that will give you an idea
when to use each next up
usr or user user is generally the
largest directory on a newly installed
system
it's used to store application programs
however all data here should contain
unchanging static data
situations like booting a live usb can
cause usr to be mounted read-only
this is where slash var helps out by
always being writable
among the various sub-directories invar
is slash var cache
which contains cache data from
application programs
var lib contains dynamic data libraries
and files
var log contains various log files var
spool contains mail news and printer
cues
as you can see var complements the
programs and user by giving them a place
to write data
another important directory and root is
called bin bin contains all the ready to
run programs that are needed to start
the system
it contains all the basic command line
tools needed to repair an os in case it
breaks
here you'll find the shells like bash
and a lot of the shell commands like ls
cd
tar kill and vi the program stored here
can be run by both the root
administrative user and by ordinary
users aspen is a lot like ben except its
contents are administrative tools that
are only available for the root
administrative user
home contains the user's home directory
you can expect to see a folder here for
every user on the system
this folder is where a file browser or
command line shell would open for a
typical user
it contains all the standard desktop
documents music type folders you would
expect to see as a regular desktop user
on the command line the home folder is
often shortened to a tilde this means
the same thing as slash home
username the administrative user on gnu
linux is called root
not to be confused with slash which is
also called root the admin root user's
home directory is the only one not in
slash home
and instead is stored in slash itself
this is more or less the same idea
as the directory we just went over
except this is owned by the admin user
a few directories are 100 dynamically
generated by the kernel
they use a special magic file system
created on startup that doesn't actually
exist on a hard drive
mainly these are dev proc and sys slash
dev contains device nodes which gives
user space applications access to your
device drivers
in your os's running kernel or simply
put the kernel makes files that
represent hardware on the system
a good example is how the kernel creates
a file called dev
sda for the first hard drive on the
system if you plug in a second hard
drive on the system the kernel will
create a file called slash dev
sdb there are however several dev
entries that don't correspond to
hardware devices
for example dev null dev random and dev
tty don't actually point at physical
hardware but are virtual devices
proc and systs have a lot of crossover
but proc mostly shows you information
about running processes
while cis allows you to manipulate the
running kernel
mnt or mount should be empty it's the
recommended place for mounting temporary
storage devices like usb
thumb drives or cd-roms media is the
automatic mnt
if you plug in a thumb drive while
you're running a desktop environment
like gnome or kde
it would likely get auto mounted under
media etc
or etsy is where most of the system
configuration files are stored
the hard drives that get mounted on boot
and where they get mounted to is stored
in
cfs tab the dns servers used by the
system is stored in etsyresolv.conf
if you install a service like apache web
server its configuration files will
likely end up in etsy as well
lastly let's talk about temp this is a
place applications can write data to
that's temporary
for example an office app might write
your document to slash tmp when you make
edits
then save those edits to a different
location when you save the document
the data in slash tmp is automatically
removed when your system is rebooted
thanks for making it to the end of this
deep dive on the new linux file system
thanks for watching bye
