continuing where I left off before let's
keep learning okay this is going over
one of the most confusing early concepts
of coding let's go over it in a console
though instead let's set the variable
I'll test one GATS ten now if we want to
modify what is in test one of people
starting I don't think this is
acceptable it's 20 isn't it and you know
it's it's still 10 if you want to
increment what's inside of test one you
have to reassign test one and what does
that look like looks like this test one
gets passed one plus ten I think we can
all agree that test one gets test one
does nothing right it's the same it says
store what sinuan already but if we do
test one mine is that we're actually
modifying your very cool tada
oh look they're using syntax I haven't
gone over yet let's go over some of the
syntax so they're plus gets syntax here
which is what we see here plus gets test
1 plus gets 5 and test 1
it's shorthand for test 1 it gets test 1
plus so if you if you don't want to have
to type out the variable twice one on
the what we're storing in and one on the
assignment side of the gets then you can
simply ignore that and do plus equals 5
alright instruction of all's we're
trying to figure out how much it rained
in the past year update annual rainfall
variable to include the values from
September to December
so annual rainfall cats annual rainfall
plus plus pop and this plus bluffin this
and yeah you can just keep adding like
this although if the line gets too long
it's gonna be pretty ugly so just be
aware of how long your lines are getting
and break this up pretty easily by
adding another annual rainfall gets
annual rainfall Plus that and do another
one that's annual rainfall gets annual
rainfall plus the next one and so on but
this one liner should do the trick
[Music]
give it run
oh we have September twice gotta make
sure we do that right let's take October
replace this one I'll beat it back mmm
wrong let's continue they are 100% right
you do need to comment your code
commenting your code is super useful for
anyone who's gonna read it later which
includes yourself a lot of the times so
we're gonna do some comments here
unfortunately I don't think either of
these things really need commented
because it's pretty obvious the variable
names we're getting assigned something
is is almost a comment in and of itself
but set name that city
let's give that a run well it seems to
not care but yeah you can tell you what
you can tell what each thing is doing
you could even do this just set city
info and then you can move on with the
program this code anyway um you do
whatever you want but I usually have
kind of a comment on top of the blocks
that do something so this is like
pretending or this is the block or set
out the city information and we can have
a block code that processes all that
information next numbers you guys I
already know all of this so integer
holds something doesn't have a decimal
including zeroes and negatives floats
are something to have a decimal so I had
no idea this was true but yeah you can
do scientific notation so 1.5 ^ to slide
that decimal 1 2 you got 150 that's cool
I've never used that probably cuz I
don't use that large of numbers that
often but you can there going grocery
shopping let's make a grocery list so
that you can plan your budget so we're
gonna take cucumbers cucumbers gets let
me do I want I think I want 42 cute
compass all right each cucumber is gonna
cost me want rice per you gets three
point two five okay before we move on
any more I'm gonna talk about how much
it annoys me the way they do their
variable names
Codecademy Codecademy Kok Adam II anyway
I would if I were writing this program
camelcase
my variables instead of under like
underscore them so the difference would
be rice for you I think it looks better
and just just as like clean I see both
pretty commonly but visit just at the
alternative way of doing it so you pick
which one looks prettiest to you do note
though that this code Academy place is
going to require you to use these
underscores for the time being because
it's that's how they check if the
programs execute it right say check for
variable names which aren't camel cased
unfortunately alright we got the third
part so now we want to set the total
cost to 42 it's just a cucumber value
and the price per cucumber that's a plus
sign David that's multiplication sign so
we're doing 32 multiplied by three point
two five and stowing that in total and
it's gonna parse out what's in total and
tell us we're doing it right oh it wants
us to print it print I feel like being
an ass again that's okay I'm on no I'm
totally gonna be done time forty two x
three point two five one thirty six
point five and because I'm not a lazy
person
let's typecast that with all the
parentheses we need oh it didn't like
that what if we do this does that let us
trick their parser yes it does what no
all right let's do this they're
going over integer division and regular
division I kind of did that in the last
video but let's see how they go over it
wrong so I don't know if this has
changed in Python 3 or what let's
actually test that test that - - oh it
is a thing that's different in Python 2
versus Python 3 now that would get a
little confusing the maths I'm sure but
yeah what they're saying is back in the
Python 2 days if you divide an integer
by a different integer it's going to
always do intricate division now on the
Python 3 days if you want that to happen
you need to typecast the results store
like that so let's go back to Python 3
set up 7/2 look at the quotient and you
see it's 3.5 and less we type past it so
that definitely is a difference between
Python 2 and 3 keep it in mind
all right so integer division is useful
that does have scenarios but you do need
to kind of force it in Python 3
giving you a couple more rundown of how
to typecast make it a float so that it
comes out yep yep yeah okay so you have
come home from the grocery stores with
100 cucumbers to split amongst yourself
and five roommates six people total
create a variable called cucumbers with
six 100 on people hold six okay so we're
just gonna do it the Python 3 method
cucumbers divided by number of people
and we've been that out thanks all right
gotta spell everything right David okay
so let's go over this program real quick
we're setting up cucumbers at 100 and
I'm people with six then we're taking
we're doing some integer division
figuring out how many whole cucumbers
there are per person storing it in here
and then printing that out yes this was
some pretty ugly variable names okay and
then it wants us to figure out how many
leftovers there are so then we're gonna
take this set it to cucumbers use
numbers modulus the number of people so
we're doing in true division here we're
getting the truncated integer of of how
many each person could use and then
we're saying what was left over with
modulus so it's going to do the division
and then it since it doesn't go and even
it'll divide divide divide by to be like
oh here's left over doesn't divide
equally and then there's your modulus I
don't know that makes any sense but it
makes a lot of sense to me so
spread that out anyway don't we just
print out this really long very one I
don't want Ike wrong so there it is
number of people some people cool oh it
doesn't want the remainder of the
cucumber's of how many's left over it
just wants one of these to be a float so
that it's that's superdumb but I've cast
oops
give that a run and we're not doing
modulus anymore so okay they should have
done the modulus because I don't want to
reinforce modulus a little but they
didn't so we're just gonna move on from
that
next multi-line strings this is a string
a pound is a comment a single quote or
Dipple quotes what's stuck in between
them is a single line string and then if
you want a multi-line string you can one
two three
but whatever the hell you want to bend
eight lines as you want one two three to
end back you can set this up like test
gets this and then test would print out
that garbage plop that on into here yeah
you can see it it just does that but if
you know if we print this it'll look a
little better there we go backslash n is
the new line character is equivalent to
the Enter key without actually having an
Enter key
yep interesting tidbit there are a
couple of use cases from multi-line
strings one is this you want to assign a
variable of something that's more than
one line alternative to this would be
with the backslash ends backside and so
that's the same as well with the single
quote or the single set of double quotes
and then the other use case is if you
want to comment something that's
multiple lines as I went over last video
you can have a floating string in your
program it just doesn't do anything so
if you have any really long comment you
want to say and don't want to want to
put a pound beginning of each line a
multi-line comment is pretty common to
use lots
I don't know but you can just put in as
much comment as you want there and then
continue with it so the downside to
having a long floating string in your
program is it isn't overly efficient you
are just arbitrarily wasting memory to
have a string there but they didn't ever
implement a multi-line string besides
that's their multi-line comment besides
that so it is what it is yeah let's see
what they want us to make those do
create a variable like you get
in highlighting this I've noticed that
mine has a space here while theirs does
not have a space here
I find that immensely frustrating and I
think early users would find that pretty
frustrating too ok Codecademy you
shouldn't give a crap if there are empty
spaces in here at all so I wouldn't I
would make your parser a smidge bit
better it wouldn't be that hard you
would just need to look through each
line and do a strip statement you could
write it in like 15 lines of code I
don't know how many people would get
stuck here with little spaces and weird
places but it's a waste of everyone's
time so moving on bullying's are another
variable type and there's also something
called boolean logic that we can go into
a smidge bit as well so let's pop over
into this console and do true/false all
right those are the two boolean
expressions that exist we can store them
true get true/false s-pulse
so I have a variable name true that
holds the boolean value of true I hope
that's not too confusing they are just
arbitrary by variable names I could just
put false to here as well it's not a
problem but something I couldn't do or
something you shouldn't do is put a
capital F there because that's just
weird
don't use there are certain things you
should just not use as variable names
and true and false is one of them all
right one of the most common things
you're gonna use boolean's for our if
statements so you say if some boolean
statement so let's just do true
hi okay
of course it printed hi because if true
is true but we could also have done if
false or true still sets hi so it's
saying if this is set to true or if this
is set to true and no it will check both
but it will short-circuit so if this was
true it wouldn't ever check this because
it's looking for one or the other it can
be both but it doesn't give a damn it if
it's both so if we wanted it to be if
you want true and true we'd have to do
it false and and that does nothing oh
let's do something cooler if I was do
test cats
well if test is greater than six Flint
and since 12 is greater than six this
boolean expression is evaluated as true
so it comes out with saying if true
print hi but if we set test to four and
rerun the above expression it doesn't do
anything I'm sure it's gonna go a little
bit deeper into boolean expressions so
let's just keep eating up whatever they
say this is a really weird example
they're asking us to read this and see
that this person is 21 and then because
they're 21 gauge is 12
balls that all we're doing here okay
very loose touch on bullying expressions
there this slide is almost exactly what
I've done before playing in a console
it's talking about typecasting so in
this line age is 13 I am at the age a
string of five years old
that's super ironic that they use that
example - okay um let's just skip down
to whatever it's making us do create a
variable called product that contains a
result of multiplying the float value of
float one and two how was that heart
multiply is a star plus as a plus really
ought to get that right David okay now
it wants us to create a large string
that has the data this
but where that is a string like this
and because I want to see that run that
well it's 10 and since I'm terribly
interested to see their parsing
abilities it seems to not care about
that pretty cool let's just move on
though all right so we've looked at a
bunch of stuff let's just do their test
why not create a variable called skill
completed set it equal to some Python
syntax and then run and then stage to
create a variable called exercise is
completed and set it equal to 13 13
don't forget to delete this backslash
points per exercise gets 5 sub - okay
create variable called point total and
set it to 100
update total point to be what it was
before plus the result what update total
point to be what it was before plus the
result of multiplying exercise completed
and points per exercise
we initialize the total points here to
100 update total points to be what it
was before not initialized plus the
and per points per day I'll be honest
their directions here are pretty bad
pretty bad I don't even know if this is
what it's looking for yeah okay it wants
a face total of the points just totally
gonna fudge this and just because I like
cleanliness I like to put parentheses
around the things I want to execute
first rather than letting it happen
automatically so we're going to multiply
these two and then add 100
points per exercise we're gonna add a
comment here that says this oh
there's your comment happy with that
print a string to the console that says
I got whatever points okay
rinse I should show you some of the cool
ass Python 3 syntax for printing out
variable names and level of strings it's
pretty awesome do that another time
though print alright dot plus and a
space points exclamation mark I should
do it 165 points all right well that
sounds like a very good stopping thanks
for watching bye
