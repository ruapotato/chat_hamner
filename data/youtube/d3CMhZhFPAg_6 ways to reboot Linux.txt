hello and welcome back everybody I'm
gonna give you the best ways to reboot a
Linux server so starting with the most
obvious reboot halt power all of those
do the same thing but also shut down -
ash are those are the clean ways to shut
down a server you can also use the init
system like init 6 that says switch to
the run level reboot that will also
reboot your server but let's say shits
broken I hope you have magic keys
enabled because those are really useful
in a system like this you just have to
remember reboot
even if system entirely broken and to
execute these all you do is you hold
down alt sis RQ and you press each of
these keys but here's what it does it
takes control of your keyboard back from
x11
useful to capture the rest of your
keystrokes then it sends the please shut
down to your processes then it says shut
down not so nicely and then it syncs
your data to your disk this is the real
important one you want this to happen
and in fact you could honestly just do s
U and B instead but it's better to do
all of them it announced the system
read-only and then it forced reboots the
server immediately you could also do a C
here instead which would just shut down
the server instead of reboot that's the
ways I know how to shut down a Linux
server thanks for watching
you
