look what peer ISM just sent me in the
mail it's a birch version of the leap
from five this is a rather small batch
and it's the first batch that was
shipped customers first things first
audio if you're an owner of the Libre
five you'll notice that the phone is
rather silent if you fiddle around with
the gnome settings it still won't help
this is because the volume controls
aren't linked to any hardware mixers yet
to get audio output working in general
you'll need to install and use also a
mixer so hop on the phone via SSH and
install also util then run also mixer
and you can adjust the sound level
freely
but alarms do go off as long as the
device is powered on and audio is
enabled the date time was messed up when
I first got the device but after adding
a SIM card the clock self corrected and
picked the right time zone all right so
the biggest issue with the Libre five is
definitely the power in my experience
the Libre five can't hold or maintain a
charge while powered on and plugged in
however this will not charge the device
at least not within a few weeks powered
off this is not an issue although it
will get warm to the touch just charging
with a Libre five fully charged and also
connected to a charger it ended up
pulling about 205 milliamp hours in just
a half hour which is the total capacity
of the phone so now if you're okay with
a bit less Pepe Ness you can force the
CPU to stay at 1 gigahertz ed of
boosting to 1.5 when the phone is busy
doing things
it won't help standby time as in standby
oh it never boosts to 1.5 anyway but it
should increase the duration that you
can actively use the device although
more testing is needed to know for sure
while working with a device over SSH I
found this command rather helpful to
check on the battery status here's what
the phone looks like while idling
the keyboard feels like a proper
smartphone keyboard although I did see
it repeat keys when I forced the CPU to
stay at 1 gigahertz EPU is allowed to
boost to 1.5 this does not seem to be an
issue I do miss having input predictions
though one feature I've seen added and
removed from Android countless times is
the ability to search through your own
applications which is now working just
fine on the Liebherr 5 big thanks to
Nicole and Pierre ISM for getting me a
working deaf kid the extra time they
took to solder on the serial connections
was a nice touch on the Libre 5 birch
you can receive calls and even hear what
the other person is saying but they
cannot hear you I was also able to make
a phone call using the dev kit but the
audio quality was very poor sadly I
didn't get a recording of it as far as
reception it's better than what I'm
already getting with my sailfish OS
device with my Sony I have to step
outside my apartment to receive calls or
texts although I've only tested the
device where I live and where I work I'm
sure results will vary depending on what
bans are available where you are
arguably one of the most important
features is texting which works for the
most part when you go to text somebody
new the known contacts app never opens
if you open them contacts manually and
add someone it will show up as an option
to text but selecting them won't work
but if somebody else texts you it's
trivial to reply to them it works as
expected
another issue is there's no audio played
when you receive a text overall the
device is a joy to use it's becoming
more and more dependable I mean just
look at this uptime they definitely like
to keep their kernels up to date as well
just for fun I messed around and
installed a couple file browsers but
none of them really seemed usable so if
you want to look at what files you have
the best way is command line fortunately
tinkering with apps is simple you can
cleanly install whatever you want and
simply remove it if it doesn't work
messing around in this manner I found a
few games already that it worked really
well
lights-off is working just fine and this
one has multi-touch input working pretty
cool
the built-in browser works just fine for
basic tasks if you need to search for
command or research and air this browser
will do just fine if you want to consume
videos this is not the browser you're
looking for at least not yet
inevitably an app will eventually Hank
and when they do you can pop open the
usage app and simply kill whatever is
broken this will even let you kill Fache
itself although doing so is not
recommended one of the bigger issues is
the power button it will lock the screen
once the libre v is powered on but in
order to turn on the labor v you have to
pop in and out the battery a software
solution should be coming down the road
i also saw a few less critical bugs
the first tab after you unlock a screen
brings up the top menu thing if you
disconnect and reconnect from Wi-Fi
sometimes internet takes a while to come
back up also the reboot acts like a
shutdown the only thing keeping me from
using this is my daily driver is the
poor battery performance I'm sure the
bigger battery coming in just not will
help but software improvements will also
be needed in order to get this phone
through a day thanks for watching bye
you
