one of my growing passions is old
computer hardware
getting linux running on a 386 and unix
running on something older than that
are my ultimate goals at the moment
sadly my 386 board that boots has a real
potato for a bios
it won't boot anything i've tried so far
earning it this place of shame on the
wall
i'm also building this monster i got
this sucker to power on
just once right after this picture was
taken i reset to factory settings
i don't know why i did this as the board
was likely already as reset as it needed
to be by being powered off for countless
years
this is the screen i'm stuck at now i've
tried to replace all the crazy old ram
and i've even tried different
arrangements of ram but without any luck
i have a feeling that i've nuked this
bios and it will need to be reflashed
trouble is i don't have a chip flasher
and even if i did i don't know if i
could find a bios for this really old
board
my 286 luggable has a decent bios for
its age
the most i've managed to get this to do
is to print e repetitively
until i powered down the system this is
when i attempted to boot a copy of xenix
looking up in the manual this means
error booting
not super helpful i do plan to test out
a bunch of other os's and to retry a few
os's over a 5.2 inch floppy drive
just to see if that helps booting
anything i also have a number of old
motherboards
this one powers on and has a bunch of
built-in ethernet
cool i've also picked up a few of these
guys so far
no signs of life any advice on getting
os's running on these old computers is
welcome
this beauty is my favorite at the moment
it has a 100 megahertz pentium processor
the bios seems to like booting floppies
and even that is pretty picky
the best way i've found to boot this
machine is with this really epic boot
floppy
this floppy boots and lets you select a
number of tools one of which allows you
to start up cds
very handy the best os i have found so
far is called basic linux
it takes just two floppies to boot and
install the first image gets dd directly
to the floppy
this is a really sensitive process make
sure to let the floppy indication light
turn off after you've run
and see the sync command return if even
a bit is out of place this won't boot
the other file is a bit more challenging
to write
in my opinion you need to format a
floppy by running this command
i find it kind of odd that you don't
have to put down a partition table first
then mount the floppy and copy over the
compressed archive
with the install media made booting the
first disk starts up lilo and eventually
asks for the second flopping
once fully booted you'll have access to
a fully featured shell
this os has no issue seeing my hard
drive which means i can install it
the process to install is more or less
use fdisk to lay down a partition table
and add at least one partition next
format with an ext2 file system and
mount it under
hd he will ask you to swap to floppy
disk 1 after it's completed copying disk
2.
with that done we can reboot to our new
install of basic linux
i've tested two different network cards
one isa and the other pci
and neither of them show up but getting
this computer online is really not
needed for its primary purpose
using this computer i can take a 1.2
megabyte floppy image
held on a bigger 1.44 megabyte floppy i
did that directly to the 5.2 inch floppy
drive
yeah i think she's dead it's not a super
elegant solution to writing old floppy
disks but it opens up a bunch more
testing i can do with my 286
which might not be able to boot from
these newer floppies using a boot floppy
you can also boot the latest version of
dsl linux on this computer i can't get
this to install but it's a much more
advanced gui than basic linux
basic linux also ships with a gui it's
really just a way of running commands
but i like it
surplus gizmos is just too close to
where i live i could not help but pick
up this oddity
this old spaceball is a serial mouse not
exactly common in 2021 but actually not
super hard to make work in linux simply
plug it into a serial to usb
and run this command this will make the
spaceball show up as a joystick
using a tool like huge joypad you can
program its behavior
this is actually pretty cool you can
twist the ball in any direction
you can push the ball in any direction
and you can pull up and down on it
i can't say i'm switching anytime soon
but i could see how this would be fun
for some games
thanks for watching bye
