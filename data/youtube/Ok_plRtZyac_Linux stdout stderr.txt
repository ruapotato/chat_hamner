if you run a terminal command the output
has to go somewhere right for example LS
is how you look around on a terminal the
output is printed to your terminal
screen so in this case standard out is
printed to our terminal window right
here now we can also make an error
message come up by doing slash not here
and that's not a directory that exists
so it gives me this error message now
this error message is actually printed
to standard error which in this case is
also the terminal window but they are
actually separate pipes you can separate
them I'll only show you we have printed
the screen a standard message and print
it to the screen a standard error
message let's go ahead and manipulate
them a little so LS now greater than
this is redirect character is how we put
stuff into a file so LS redirect to a
arbitrary file let's do a file in this
directory called out dot txt and you'll
notice there's no output cuz the program
LS instead of printing its standard
output to the screen it printed its
standard output to this file I'm gonna
cat that file which just prints out its
content it just says whatever LS said
let's go back to our not here example if
we redirect that to the same file you'll
see it still prints the error message
because we only redirected standard out
to the file not standard error and all
the messages were to standard error so
if we want to redirect both you put and
in front of the greater-than sign and
that says redirect both standard air and
standard out okay so if you just want to
redirect standard air we can replace
that with it too and since everything is
an error everything still went to out
text yeah that's kind of the main ways
to print to a file but what if we want
to make the output of one program the
input of another that's done with a pipe
so let's do something about it like LS
dot slash just LS is simpler whatever LS
and then we're going to pipe that into
another program
let's do prep and since grep is a
searching tool let's search for
something and we have how about RPM so
we run LS which prints this stuff to
standard out but that stops redirected
into grab which searches for RPM in this
case and we get a nice filtered output
of these files so that's one of the use
cases for redirecting to a program you
could also redirect it to let's say cut
let's say all of these have a period who
is ready we can do grep for any period
so anything that has an extension okay
how to put a backslash in front of that
because it was doing regular expressions
and in regular expressions dots one dot
means match any character so here is LS
filtered down to all of things that have
a dot or an extension now we can pipe
that stuff over to cut tell it to cut on
[Music]
if it's gonna do the same thing but
let's try the delimiter of period and we
want the field to so the last part okay
cool so this runs at last which gives us
all of the files we pipe that to graph
which searches for anything that has an
extension then we pipe that to cut which
cuts off that extension there are a
couple product files and a couple text
files in this directory about it thanks
for watching bye
