UEFI is not scary it's not difficult
it's not that hard let's go over it so
you can actually start using it I'm
gonna install Lubuntu
this VM is being forced to boot via UEFI
we're going to will detect if you start
the installer with UEFI and fortunately
you can automatically install for you
but let's say you have another
computer's operating system on there and
you want to actually understand how to
partition UEFI yourself it's not hard
I'm gonna go ahead and manually
partition this just so you can see
exactly how it's done
new politician table okay
so the first thing you want the very
first partition is the EFI boot
partition we want to find efi system and
what that will do is it will format it
with fat32 and it will also make it have
a mount point of slash boots slash efi
on a lot of different distros and make
it about half a gig
now I'm gonna add my root partition I
want it to be I want to leave about a
gig so I can have some swap space and
then swap space and that's a really
basic efi partition scheme you got your
boot route and swap now there are actual
reasons to set up efi and not be lazy
yeah it is an extra partition but you
gain the ability to use GPT partition
tables that's cool because now you can
use disks that are larger than 2
terabytes as well as set up more than 4
primary partitions very useful if you
want to have a crapload of operating
systems on a single drive plus I hear
they're adding more features to UEFI and
they'll be more recent than the future
to use it so might as well learn it now
thanks for watching
