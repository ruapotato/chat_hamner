this is lavender lavender has this mode
this is window management mode when
you're not in window management mode you
can drag out windows with right-click
inside your new window is janet
janet is a terminal based menuing system
janet lets you set targets like files or
ip addresses
and then from there run functions
against it like add repository tell me
how big it is
etc etc
it also has a built-in menuing system so
you can type in a category here and see
what's inside the category
if i type in the name of the application
it runs
and
here's this
we can go back into window management
mode and move it around if we touch the
corner
it will resize the window
and here's the game
works just fine
back to the menu system
and internet
and web browser
firefox hooray
cool back to window management mode zoom
out with the mouse will
and you can see all of my windows that
are open
i'm going to drag my firefox window over
here and zoom way in because we want our
windows to be around the same size
and never get too far off from the same
size
and let's load up a random youtube video
huzzah
things are working
janet's still a work in progress and a
lot of functions need added but as far
as basic menuing goes it works pretty
okay
and lavender while not entirely stable
yet
works pretty okay too
see i don't even know what office
equipment i have on here but uh
because this nice menu i can run
document viewer which god knows what the
actual command is for that but i'm able
to run it hooray and resize it
and we can rearrange all these windows
so we can see them side by side
all right well basic window manager
