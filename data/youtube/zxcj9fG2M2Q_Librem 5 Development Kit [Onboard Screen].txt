after purism put together the first
libram 5 death kit they ran into an
unexpected issue the on board displays
did not function properly
waiting for the on-board displays to
function would have resulted in some
very lengthy delays but the amazing
people over appear is 'm managed to
verify the issue was in software and not
in hardware and in fact was the
initialization sequence of the hardware
that was the underlying cause so they
felt pretty ok with shipping the
hardware despite this initialization
issue meaning we had to all go out and
buy a stuff needed to hook up a dev kit
to a monitor mouse and keyboard it turns
out hooking all of these things up is
non-trivial due to the fact that USB
roll switching is not fully implemented
at the moment the folks over appear ISM
did manage to figure out how to one time
program the screens which was use a
special black box to send the
initialization sequence to the screen
directly once this was done you never
had to resend that initialization
sequence and the displays just
functioned that's great for the people
at Pearson who can just get that done
anytime but for the developers who
didn't have access to the special black
box required for the one time
programming didn't really have that many
options but it was offered at FOSDEM so
in early february you could bring your
dev kit and have the purism folks one
time program it which resulted in new
having ain't working screen to test with
everyone else didn't have to wait that
long though because on February 20th a
full software patch was created this
allowed the kernel to send that special
meaning all we had to do was reflash
with the latest peers and builds and our
screen should just magically work we
flashed the new latest image from purism
give it a reboot and it's still a black
screen turns out we have one of the dev
kits that have a boost display cable
this teeny little ribbon cable here has
loose in shipping or while we had it or
I don't really know
probably a while ago and try as we might
we just can't get this teeny ass or Ivan
cable back in its hole
so before we mangle this any more than
we've already mangled it it's time to
take this guy over to a board repair
shop
fortunately crafty guy also has a def
kit and lives near me
crafty guy is working hard on
post-market OS which is sure to be one
of the more interesting operating
systems available for the leap from five
this build of post-market OS is
defaulting to KDE plasma mobile which
does look very nice it's got the
standard Android slide down from the top
just like Fache the phone application
does not have any data so we'll just
move on you can see your open
applications from here as well as close
them and slide up for your apps kind of
just like Bosh and so far it's looking
like KDE is winning as far as things
implemented even though Fache is coming
along quite quickly okay I'm sure you've
noticed the slow framerate this is
caused by the open source GPU driver it
still needs work however I do have high
hopes for smooth graphics on the dev kit
because using Linux frame buffer allows
for some pretty smooth graphics anyway
thanks for watching bye
