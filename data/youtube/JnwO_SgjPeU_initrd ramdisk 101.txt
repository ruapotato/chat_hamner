hello and welcome back I'm gonna show
off the in and Ardie what exactly is
this thing well it turns out it's a
little root filesystem that's loaded
before your regular root filesystem it's
an intermediate boot stage where your
disc drivers and other hardware drivers
are loaded once that's complete it
mounts your root filesystem over itself
and launches your run level system so in
order to break this I'm just going to go
to my Linux line find this root equals
bit and we're going to set it to SDA one
in my scenario which is actually my swap
space I'm on purpose braking the boot so
here we go it's loaded the initial Ram
disk and it's not succeeded in mounting
root if you see this prompt this type of
output your systems broken for the most
part and you've got to do recovery
fortunately you can chew roots from an
environment like this so if I wanted to
chew root into my Susa install and
regenerate the grub files I would do
something like this
all right so from here I've got a mostly
booted system but with the caveat of my
run level system isn't working
so even so this is not a properly booted
system but it's good enough to pop open
yes to go to boot loader and make it
regenerate all of those config files now
most of the time when you end up in the
RAM disk you're gonna take a look at dev
and SD whatever won't show up that's
probably the most common scenario and
that means that your RAM disk is lacking
whatever driver is necessary to read
your disk in my scenario
it was just a grub configuration issue
and regenerating the grub file was
enough it cannot read your hard drive
properly you want to regenerate your in
and RD file which can be done by simply
reinstalling the kernel or on Susa
running m'kay in a tardy both should
work and if if you still run into issues
at that point you're gonna have to
research which module is necessary to
include in your in and rd in order for
it to boot properly which is usually a
bit of research it's not too hard to do
but each distribution will have you will
include it slightly differently and
generate the energy slightly differently
so have fun Google about
