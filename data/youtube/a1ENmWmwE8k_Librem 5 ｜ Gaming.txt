sebastien one of the badass devs over at
piers him messed around with some common
open-source games on the labrum 5 let's
check out what he got running and go
over some of the useful tweaks he used
in order to get these games up and going
all credit for this goes to Sebastian it
is truly amazing what an experienced
developer can do in such a short amount
of time
do note applying some of these tweaks
have side effects it is good practice to
have a valid backup and it's not a bad
idea to check out the steps to reflash
the phone if something does go wrong if
you're not feeling that adventurous
don't worry some games do work out of
the box for example scummvm this gives
you the ability to run a large amount of
classic old point and click games
there's also a handful of gnome games
that just work 2048
Ches
lights off
you
and this slighty game
you can also run boiled corn which does
look like some fun on the go you can
even play some web browser-based games
if you're looking to get your dance on
non-competitive singing potatoes is the
app you're looking for
it's rather creative and funny if
spiders don't freak you out
spider disco also works without
modification the first useful hack is
messing with the hid pie scaling this
can be done by creating a folder copying
a file to that folder then editing that
file a bit I'm not really sure which of
these need edited so I'll just do them
all then you can simply reboot the phone
or to save time just restart Fache and
everything is small the login screens
hilariously small and once logged in all
the icons are small so yeah if you're
not too afraid of a small UI this does
help a number of games for example Vegas
the UI is small but it still looks like
fun the battle for wesnoth also looks
pretty good on the labrum five in small
desktop mode the menus in never ball
look absolutely perfect on a touchscreen
but the ball controls themselves barely
function I would love to see gyro
controls implemented in this game edge
Wars is also playable but it did take a
bit of extra work to get that touch
input working nicely done sometimes the
issues aren't graphical or even touch
related but the game is instead built
for a keyboard for those games you can
swap out the default keyboard for vert
board which offers arrow keys and a few
other useful keyboard inputs to swap out
the keyboard simply install vert board
then just edit this file a bit this is a
super simple script and it could be a
lot of fun to hack in a joypad with a
couple buttons you can also run frozen
bubble it helps to set a chai dpi to 1
and of course use this alternative
keyboard super tux is also playable with
hid PI plus vert board enabled Mesa 19.3
is not included by default in pls just
yet but if you're feeling adventurous
you can try building a root filesystem
of some other distro and simply change
route into the new environment here's
what I did
apt installed a bootstrap then build a
chi root of debian CID then do the
nominal G root stuff
I'm actually not positive how to install
Mesa 19.3 but it should be possible from
this environment but with Mesa 19.3 you
can play a few more games for example
super tux cart the UI is very usable and
gameplay is not just passable but you
can actually play and win a match
I can't wait for this to be easily
installable I'll totally be playing this
on the go any match also benefits from
some of the 19.3 Mesa it's nice to see
such a polished game running so early
into the release of the Libra 5 as you
can see the state of gaming on the Libra
5 is improving day by day what games do
you want to see port up to the leap from
5 thanks for watching bye
