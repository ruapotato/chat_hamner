I made some non final software of my own
it plays audio books but before that
let's talk about retro gaming on Linux
emulation has been something Linux has
been very good at for a long time on the
desktop side of Linux we can emulate we
GameCube PlayStation 2 PlayStation 1
Sega Dreamcast n64 game boy advance Game
Boy Color Game Boy the lowest hanging
fruit here was obviously retroarch as it
comes with a crap ton of different
emulation engines called cores after
installing retro arch and loading it up
it's beautiful
it's very reminiscent of a PlayStation 3
background many animations are smooth
can't really capture that super well I
installed a couple emulation cores but I
couldn't get any of them working
including NES and n64 although getting
n64 on this would be badass I wasn't
able to get that working but held this
is based on Debian there's bound to be
something in a repository I was able to
get one of the NES emulators to work
called magnif in I think it doesn't
quite load right in Fache but in plasma
it loads fine
looks like plasma got hit with a wrench
moving on
yes that sound that beautiful sound is
coming from the devkit everybody dance
Frick Frick frickin Frick I don't know
how to bring up the keyboard and back 2x
do tool a swd seems to let me move
around but I don't know what the jump
key is to enter levels or jump about oh
let's script this so it's gotta be one
of the keys in the alphabet and go okay
so it's gotta be one of the keys in the
alphabet - a few go okay it's got to be
one of the special keys on the keyboard
and go they don't get points for
intuitive key layout but it doesn't work
quite well the bad news is I wasn't
really able to fix this during our hack
session where I have access to a fully
working deaf kid so I had to use my
personal deaf kit which unfortunately
has a broken screen so exporting is the
only way to display the video game and
it seems like 3d acceleration is broken
when you ex forward or maybe there's
just a big performance hit in any case
you can see it's way more laggy than it
was on the dev kit screen itself so bear
in mind that there is a pretty big
performance hit X forwarding but using
exporting I was able to set up the key
combinations properly and play Super
Mario Brothers 3 pretty cool
and I can sort of play this
I did test a few other games over X
forwarding as you can see here hedge
Wars does load up and you can get into
the game but it's not particularly
playable and it's a similar story for T
worlds I also tried liquid war which
while it doesn't perform quickly does
technically work flawlessly
I also wanted to say thank you to
Gardner the Linux gamer my subscriber
count' was growing at a steady rate and
then it wasn't
thanks to Gardner who decided to put a
link to one of my videos in one of his
so here's his channel running on the dev
kit over exporting thanks to getting a
Gardner I listen to audiobooks
constantly so I went to the Libra five
dogs took a peek about and it was
obvious that gtk was the way to go and I
already know Python so I went with
Python gtk as the stack loading gtk was
not so bad
I found a really useful tutorial series
by the New Boston link below it walks
you through the basics of everything you
need to know to program Python gtk apps
after learning a bit of gtk and
successfully making a clickable
interface it looks like this on a dev
kit big thanks to David who helped me
fix and clean up the interface it does
look quite nice now here's where it
stands at the moment I haven't created a
desktop file so command-line is the only
way to launch it at the moment
selecting an audiobook looks a lot
better on the desktop I'm thinking I
might replace this entire file selection
dialog with a in window file selection
thingy
I don't have audio setup with exporting
so I'll have to wait for the next hack
session to have a fully working def get
to test audio output but here's the same
app running on my desktop
taps you saw and young people he's about
a laughter thought better of it it was a
few seconds has done at last he said in
a stand where among just outside fear
flood chapter two the vanishing chapter
three the letters pretty cool right as
always thank you to my patrons by
