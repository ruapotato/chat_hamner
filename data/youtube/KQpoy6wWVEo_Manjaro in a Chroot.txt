for no reason I've decided that I'm
going to try to switch to me and djaro
in the hardest way that I can imagine I
switch I mean not really switch I mean
like use Manjaro and my favorite
operating system at the same time so I'm
gonna build a Chu root of Manjaro
try to use its tools learn its ways of
doing things and even install like OBS
and all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I need inside of
Manjaro and use that
[Music]
we want the smallest one what's the
smallest one xfce is fine we're gonna go
with the xfce official branch minimal
for sure the minimal one
oh that's great all right let's take a
look at this file and see if we can't
find a root filesystem inside of it
that's it this is what we got
well this looks promising who we have
here
Oh what do we have here
are these it's gotta be this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'll
be is s directory
we need to know what the SF s file is q2
that's not how I open it how do I
extract one shower light
what did that just do Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we just
got some she again yeah nothing so we're
gonna have to do that for all of those
squashes I think so see me dubbed opt CD
x86 that's the swash command that a
squash command worked really well slash
which we got we got fruit FS we've got I
don't know what that is okay
do that too and we'll do the desktop s
FS okay so theoretically theoretically
we just built the live install
environment in the side of downloads
temp yeah let's see if we did I guess
sudo su temp cat at C star star Oh
bitchin well tell you what
it didn't not work it seemed to have
worked did that make sense no it worked
it did work we have a qu root of Manjaro
here oh you know what we mean it's right
thank you past me for all your help
first things first MV temp to man djaro
MV Manjaro
çb Manjaro okay here are two routes and
djaro routes baby shoe routes okay we
got a man jar oh that's pretty okay or I
and sis and now the scripts not
beautiful but it certainly functions
slash Manjaro dollar sign I done what
Duff just happened yeah Manjaro now has
things in it let's cheer it into this
now and see what the Frick happens
X Oh bus run that as a regular user
open terminal goes boss thank you
now we just need to choo-choo root su
tech ask at Etsy store yeah
Skaar good CD
there's nobody in home um empty one I
think
it was a bad idea I meant a full one
there it is
it's at a launcher
oh okay I didn't work at all at this hey
that's the one remove remove hey just
kind of fun workspace switcher okay
terminal okay just make sure we're not
like felicitating cat that's the star
who needs an installer
yeah that's pretty schwifty
but I need another like manager or a
user what's the live user in Anjar oh um
I can't believe we're running Manjaro
right here oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it even has like that
rat background a little hybrid operating
system what rather I read oh let's make
a user David with the user ID of
whatever my user ID is and let's mount
my home folder inside the Manjaro
oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] inside the Manjaro home folder
so to do that we just need to look at my
password file okay so this is the line
for my user fortunately it's ID 1000
more than a hundred I think it's a
thousand anyway it should be the default
I'm hoping it's gonna be the default on
that jar Oh as well yeah
Stucky can we just go ahead and pop that
I quit
s you David okay trying to change
directories I think but that's BB David
great so I don't know if that's that
actually works okay let's go ahead and
mount so with mouth - - are behind slash
slash David Chiu roots in jar oh okay
then we can just come here I see David
tick CD bus cave we're now proper user
let's go ahead
excellent where's the source [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you
the one running everything go away okay
SC David tick xfce for subtract panel we
use a default one oh wow uh-huh now I
can do it this one around awesome sweet
so now we're running as a proper user
well it's this one yeah that's just way
better remove this
no no about okay
now we're talking
um this we can remove a little move
all right now we're running pretty okay
we've got like border effects nice
compositing going on my mattei is still
functioning that's still working pretty
good terminal and here get a default
directory is a route that's pretty weird
I'm gonna fix that via the happiest way
I can think of yeah I know I know it's a
horrible fix is it now if we go to file
browser so unfortunately thinks it
soundtrack trees root so no it's not a
good fix I would say the biggest problem
is half the icons are missing I don't
really know what the icons are located
but my guess is it some permissions
issue simple shown arch mod would fix it
we're gonna rebuild smite Batman repos
are totally totally screwed up
it's reading everything wrong your Chi
root is malformed and has no slash mount
point oh I understand
I think now that our our find slash
slash I did that off-camera so mount are
buying slash slash is my idea based on
this input let's try it again
yes thank you bro so yeah I wants you to
our bind root to root so now that that's
complete we should be able to install
get with Pak Pak man - Apple s get
proceed with installation that's what
I'm talking about
um where we want to install next cattle
ass oh yes it's a - broadcasting
they have a direction - studio kit no
it's probably just - studio - oh okay
very good if this works you get some you
get some points you get some points bro
I don't buy it
that was it oh yes failed to initialize
video your GPU may not be supported or
your graphics driver may be updated okay
you think about that we needed to
install geo lacks gears okay yeah well
it definitely didn't work so getting 3d
acceleration inside of Chiru
might be a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] well I'm gonna just
wing it and try to install 3d
acceleration sheet inside reroute why
not did ya see how all you do see how
well you can do install and video
drivers just run this I guess
I'm a lot of Route one Wow
it's gonna do everything for me well I
mean it's gonna try
okay well it's successfully installed so
what's the equivalent of rebooting a to
root nothing I don't I guess I'll just
exit reach you root it
that's weird Dave let's not open it via
that method let's open a via this method
I know all right
su to me and then s su David NGO that
scares export display that's : 0 J locks
cares hey it's got further failed to
request some things some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] didn't
work
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] system teacher
let's try it out system D - and s bond
Ashley - Cathy until the
don't slash actually oh my dev is
pre-mounted and pre-populated alright it
really wants to emulate Devyn run so I'm
not going to mount in Devon run she
sucks because a reboots almost
definitely required to unmount death and
run for this to route yeah it's gonna be
a reboot and maybe even a death
different episode Manjaro hybrid
operating system thanks for watching bye
