now that we have a working screen plus a
dev kit and the ribbon cable is finally
attached properly we can play with the
leaver v dev kit properly before we get
into this let's talk about the elephant
in the room the graphics are not that
smooth and this is because the open
source GPU driver needs some work
looking past the slow GPU drivers we can
look at the GUI and how it will be like
to use the keyboard is defaulting to a
opened position and definitely looks
nicer than it did in the early VN build
I think a lot of you guys are going to
be interested in seeing the web browser
so let's pop around that for a bit so
I'm loading up YouTube here just because
it's super heavy and I want to stress
the hell out of this device to see what
it might be capable of when it actually
releases it definitely is chunking along
here scrolling is sluggish let's pick a
random video to play wow it's almost
smooth it's definitely a video there are
definitely some rendering issues where
the right side of the display is kind of
cut off and not really accessible okay
well let's take a look at something else
it looks like DuckDuckGo is the default
search engine so props on that it's just
a simple web page but hey it looks like
multi-touch is working and that's pretty
cool and we can save things ctrl S on
the keyboard alright they have a file
selection screen this will be elite
reminiscent to how the file browser will
eventually look as you can see here the
image did save successfully oh I
randomly selected a bit of text at least
we can check out the copy-paste menu
that looks pretty snazzy simple right
there barely not all right let's run a
speed test on the browser cuz that's an
html5 app and html5 apps seem to be
working pretty well so run that up of
course the right sides cut off but the
app is functioning it is testing my
speed clicking on an audio file results
in a web browser trying to display the
audio files contents not quite right and
the video files do seem to work so
click on a raw video file and it opens
up in its own little tab all right well
let's download this and try to play it
on something else other than the browser
cuz it's chunking along and cuts off a
little early video downloaded all in all
the web browsers not doing so bad the
multi-touch support is there so it has a
lot of promise and once the GPU driver
is sorted out it's gonna be just a
little bit of rendering issues that need
to be resolved specifically with that
right side being chopped the hell off
and some random chat window popped up
looks like a cool feature though if I
could pop up the chat window
purposefully with chats in it I would
kept running into this now and then
definitely a GPU driver thing at this
point we SSH in and use systemctl
restart Fache to recover the Foss shell
and due to the lack of a file browser we
can't really attempt to open our saved
file just by clicking on it so we're
gonna go ahead and open up document
viewer ok document reviewers interface
is particularly unstable moving on I'm
really not sure how to close apps for
this app drawer ok we'll have to install
em player easy enough because it's you
know based on Debian apt-get install and
player so playing the video seems to
crash the interface but playing with
just audio works great next let's take a
look at the calendar UI adding a new
appointment is pretty simple you just
kind of tap it and type in details and
you can edit those details
repeat reminders how long it's gonna be
and again the right side of the screen
is cut off we are looking at you Lib
handy we'll talk more about that a bit
next we pull out the SIM card from my
phone shove it in an adapter and shove
it in the dev kit I blame the adapter
but this was a very tight fit and I
actually had to use pliers to pull out
the SIM card when we were done testing
so we reboot the device with the SIM
card in the cellular icon did change to
well that
and we did try to make a couple calls
the result of every call though was
either a hung interface a completely
crashed Fache or in one case we got a
timed out error and some interesting V
messages talking about the modem
registration state I'll definitely need
to pop into the dev forum and see if
there's some extra steps that I'm
missing to get this hooked up properly
to t-mobile at some point we had to
reboot and we tried it with the
interface just clicking on the power
button there it didn't give us any
indications that it was rebooting except
that it became unresponsive and
eventually just did reboot there's a
valid way to reboot but I would
definitely push for a menu that says are
you sure you want to reboot popping in
an SD card formatted with ext4 worked
just fine
LS BLK shows that the SD card was
detected and is mountable we didn't test
with any Windows formats like fat or
NTFS but I don't really need access to
those formats I'd rather just use the
Linux ext4 format okay everybody loves 2
X 4 word their desktop but now you can
export your phone's desktop purism has
some pretty simple directions to follow
if you want to X forward over ssh your
FASTA splay this headless setup works
pretty well for me at home and maybe my
preferred way to run the GUI but does
add some extra lag as it is dumping a
lot of the display over the network
although I was surprised to see there
were fewer graphical glitches running
this way my guess is this means live
handy is just not quite tuned right at
the display resolution of the libra 5 so
it might not even be very hard for them
to resolve all of these settings issues
and where little glitches where the
display is cut off too far right so if
you want to tweak your settings just set
up SSH and X for word year display some
of the funny issues we ran into rotation
actually worked better in the VM than it
did on the actual phone with the
keyboard defaulting to an upstate if you
just hit the rotation button end up with
the keyboard in full screen and no
weight to make it novel screen the next
funny thing we did was audio recording
the result
this was a success kind of we couldn't
get anything to record shy of outright
screaming at the deaf kid so turns out
it can record if you scream at it we
also saw a weird crash where the
keyboard ended up on top and it looked
like the application space was on bottom
pretty weird crash as you can see
fighting against the GPU bugs were the
biggest issue the graphical glitches all
the time and locked up GPU states that
it was causing but if you can look past
all of that you can see this is coming
along and will be quite an interesting
device thank you all for watching bye
