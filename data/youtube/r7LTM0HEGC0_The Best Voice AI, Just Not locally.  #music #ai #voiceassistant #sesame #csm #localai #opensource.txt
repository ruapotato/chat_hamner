okay everyone's been waiting for this
model it finally landed and it's
brutally slow locally so here's my RTX
390 testing out
CSM CSM Vision Grand a chat B to answer
on demand still buffering but something
wentong with their plans now we're all
aging while holding our hands they built
a model with voices so clear but each
word takes seconds to appear than try on
RTX 390 the best I can't AFF yet we're
watching it think slow motion slower
than dial up hey there what sh just here
to help you out and make your looking
brighter friend
nor if you need anything just give me a
shout or send a signal block your back
and that's just their
one by then I forgotten the question
it's quality over speed that's for sure
local models need patience to end cloud
services don't count they're cheating
CSM promised us a chat but gave us a
slow TTS instead we made it is For
answers while our beards grow long and
red even the
ladies so slow so slow so slow we tried
and tape we tried to stream we chunked
up the text like a fever dream Chun
slower than my grandpa's now they first
words come faster that's true but the
last ones are arrive when the topic is
through sorry I'm late what year is it
what decade is it so here's to you CSM
you taught us to wait patience is virtue
they say that's great no user ever maybe
someday you'll catch up to speed till
then we'll just pretend that we need a
very very slow
assistant
indeed and the Oscar for long its pause
goes too still waiting
