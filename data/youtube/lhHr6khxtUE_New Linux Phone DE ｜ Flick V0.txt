Okay, quick demo of the Flick shell I've
been working on. You can use a pattern
or a PIN, and you can always fall back
to your systems password. Here's the
settings app as it is. Now, you can
toggle things like the touch effect.
The core idea of the shell here is that
there are categories and you can select
a default for each category. For
example, the browser. You can long press
on it and select which browser you want
to open. When you click the browser,
a swipe down from the top edge closes an
application.
Swipe from the right edge goes to the
open app drawer.
A swipe up goes back to the home grid.
A swipe from the bottom edge just a
little bit will open the keyboard. A
swipe all the way from the bottom edge
to the top will minimize the application
and bring you back to the home grid.
You can also swipe from the left edge to
get to a quick settings. Let's demo it
on the phone.
This is a Pine phone, so excuse the
insanely bad frame rates. That's pretty
much the basic workflow.
The keyboard is built into the
compositor layer as well as all of the
swiping.
The shell and compositor share the same
code base, so it's very unified.
Anyway, thanks for watching. Bye.
phones have tried for years
down through blood and tears. A fully
[music] on a tiny screen,
but what we need is something.
Swipe up, swipe down, swipe left, swipe
[music] right. The N9 had it, they got
it right. It's early days, a mountain to
climb. The flick's going to get there
one commit at a time.
going to get there at a time.
FPS. [music]
Watching Windows move is quite the test.
Is that an app or a sideshow friend?
I fell asleep before the [music] anim.
Swipe up, SWIPE DOWN, SWIPE LEFT, SWIPE
RIGHT. Something [music] tailored,
something light. No more chain squeezed
into a bone. Flick's building is
something of its own. But hey now, hold
[music] up. Don't get too hype. This
code is fresh. It's not yet ripe. Don't
test it yet. I'm warning you. Wait till
I talk food on my X1.
When I can daily drive without the pain,
then maybe
maybe
you can try this thing.
Until then,
thanks for watching.
