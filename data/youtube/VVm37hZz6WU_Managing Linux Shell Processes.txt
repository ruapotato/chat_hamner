hello and welcome back everybody I'm
going to show you how to manage
processes in a Linux terminal all right
so let's say you started a process that
blocks your terminal for example here's
my text editor cases use it nice but
you'll notice my terminal is locked out
now there's a way I could have prevented
that I'm gonna use control-c to kill it
that killed Kate it's gone but if I
wanted to still be able to use this
terminal I couldn't I can type in the
command and an ampersand that says put
this in the background on startup so
there it is I still have shell access
and Kate is running i'm telling some
file and i want to put this in the
background but i've argued on the
command you can press ctrl-z
which will freeze or stop the program
then BG will put that into the
background so yeah I can type in
commands and I have two jobs running in
the background right now if I type in a
foreground it will foreground the last
process which basically just means it's
in its broken state it was in just
before I had press ctrl-z in the first
place
so as if I were up here just having run
tail so tel is in the foreground still
waiting for tell to exit so control Z +
BG we're back to two jobs in in in this
show to see those jobs we can run jobs
first job is Kate second job is tell we
can kill those by typing in to kill and
then % one for Kate and % to foretell in
this case referenced here or if we want
to foreground one of them we can do so
simply by going like this or this
depending if you want Kate or towel
right here we've foreground Kate we can
control see kill it and I killed it
baking foreground again that will
foreground tell kill its and job control
thanks for watching
