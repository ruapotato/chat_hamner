I wanted to briefly talk about the video
purism posted last night the video is
just one and a half images but the
images say a lot first off this seems to
be a rendering of what the phone will
look like but more importantly the top
overlay implies that they have completed
at the hardware schematic for the labrum
5 phone plus the video still says
shipping q3 which gives them more or
less three months to start shipping I
personally wouldn't be sad if they
delayed but I'm crazy excited for the
device so if it does ship soon awesome
if not I think people be happy if it
ships this year period shifting gears a
little bit so looking back at 2017 some
of the early articles that got me
excited for the dev kit said that it
would be able to run a variety of
different distributions as everybody
knows openSUSE is the shiny green star
of linux distros it has the best battery
performance and the coolest package
manager' okay it's pronounced zipper but
I had a customer once call it that back
when I did SUSE Linux support at Novell
so it's not hard to tell that I prefer
openSUSE it's not that I don't like
Debian in fact I would say Debian is my
second favorite distro PR OS being
Debian based is actually a good thing in
my eyes that doesn't mean though that I
don't want to see openSUSE running on
the Libre 5 first off this is a prime
example of hacking together this is
not a way to start an official port of
openSUSE step 1 solder some to your
dev board big shout-out to my roommate
thank you for doing the soldering for me
you only need to solder rx TX and ground
next we flash the dev kit with whatever
the latest image is but including the
options - - dirt and - - skip cleanup
this leaves behind the dev kit image
file next go to open SUSE website and
download the latest arm 64 build of
tumbleweed I went with the just enough
OS root file system then we mount our
dev kit image
not the second
petition on the Deaf get image CD to our
mount point delete all the Debian
that we're not gonna need anymore
then we can extract our openSUSE tar
file directly to Mt
next we just flashed that modified dev
kit image and we can use Pico comm to
attach that serial device we soldered on
this is pretty cool we can see the
boot-up messages
as you can see not all of this
start up well it does get stuck on the
network but do note my deaf kit has a
broken Ethernet port so that could be
the issue here
it eventually did reach the login screen
and I was able to log in after I entered
the password it kind of just sat there
looking foolish for a second kind of
freaked me out the first time I was like
oh crap
what's not working but it did login
eventually and I did get a prompt
here's openSUSE tumbleweed running on
the Lieberman v def kit it's using the
pure OS kernel but it has the root
filesystem of Susa one of the things to
note was the root file system was
read-only which was a simple fix
after remounting the root filesystem he
asked opens up fine
the partitioner opens up and you can
look around your disks
here's a quick look at the sir
manager a lot of stuff is dead but
that's to be expected with this kind of
hack job
back to PR OS I managed to compile and
run the powder to a this is a classic
falling sand game but with an absolute
crapload of options and materials after
loading it up it's obvious that the
resolution is weird I started with scale
2 just so I can access the menus a
little bit better unfortunately a lot of
the screen is cut off doing it this way
I thought about changing the resolution
in the code but that would result in
none of the online levels loading before
anybody complains that it's slow do you
know that this is running over X
forwarding via a USB C cable so I don't
see Android doing that anytime soon or
ever
anyway thanks for watching bye
