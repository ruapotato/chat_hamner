why is it so hard to upgrade or
downgrade just one package what is a
package dependency and just what would
it look like to visualize all of
debian's package requirements in 3d
space
debian is a robust distro of gnu linux
based on the dot deb package format
these packages are made of files that
get extracted to the system and scripts
that can be run if needed
debs are convenient and proven way to
install the base os new applications and
required libraries in just about every
case an application packaged as a dot
deb will have dependencies a dependency
is another package your package relies
on a good example is the graphical gtk 3
application which needs lib gtk to
function
in many cases your dependencies will
also have dependencies
which could also have dependencies and
so on the connections between these
interdependent packages make up what's
known as a dependency tree this
dependency tree is a very common image
used to depict basic package
relationships digging into the origin it
seems this image was created with apt-r
depends it turns out apt-r-depends is a
really handy way of outputting dot graph
data which can be piped into a few
different programs to create cool
looking graphs asking spring graph to
graph my entire debian system
really didn't work but i was able to
create this cool looking guy with sfdp
which is part of the package graphis
sfdp put everything in a nice circle and
can also output data in detail.graph
format so i used sfdp to create detailed
graph data from the output of appt
autopins run on the whole system
next i built a handy blender script to
render that dot graph data in 2d
to give it a third dimension i
calculated the height based on the
number of other packages using it as a
dependency
so the most dependent on packages ended
up the highest on the z-axis
this makes lip c6 the top tree in this
cool visualization i'm calling it
dependency forest as this is a tight
grouping of trees in 3d space the links
between packages are really just a list
of the package names and the needed
versions here's an example from the also
utils package by removing or changing
any of these packages you could break
also utils as well as any other packages
that depend on the changed package i bet
you could guess why messing with any of
these higher depended on packages could
cause a problem for the lower parts of
the tree thanks for watching bye
