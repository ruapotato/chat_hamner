it's happened again I forgot my root
password and my user password here's a
quick tutorial on how you can do some
password recovery on Linux we're gonna
reboot the machine and spam the down
arrow cuz right after the BIOS loads
you'll load grub and if you're not
spamming down it'll just go right on by
okey dokey so here it is scroll back up
to a boon to press e to edit scroll all
the way down to the init RD line okay
now press the left arrow and we should
be on Linux line very end space and
rewrite our W space in it equals slash
bin slash bash okie dokie so what this
does is it mounts the root filesystem
rewrite and it bypasses the init system
and just runs bash awesome
f10 boots this from here it's pretty
simple pass WD will change your root
password pass WD space a user name will
change the user names password that's it
you did it you change the root password
now from here you're gonna have to
probably take some special needs to
reboot the machine I mean hard reset
probably yep
you
