the first Libra five prototypes have
started shipping if you're just dying to
have an early badge phone take a deep
breath and relax they're pretty rare for
one and the software is now just
becoming usable evergreen or q2 2020 is
when they'll be available in mass stick
around to the end of the video to find
out how you can get a freely broom 5
that's right I'm doing a giveaway thing
[Music]
it's still early days for the lead from
five it looks like the camera video
output and call routing will need more
development before it's fully working
and integrated into the OS but I don't
see how this is any different than when
they shipped the dev kits with
non-functional screens that turned out
just fine plus the labrum file has a
much better upgrade mechanic than
Android once peer ISM fixes something
they can push the fix directly to a repo
and you can upgrade just the needed
components whereas Android would have to
do a full system upgrade to change
anything core
I don't think calling will take long to
fix and I bet it has something to do
with this bug but I'm only guessing that
the two are related if they are then
perhaps they've disabled the audio until
they can correct for some Distortion
okay so calls is a work in progress but
what about a software solution after
installing mumble and Qt Weyland five
which might be useful to include by
default the mumble you I started up it
could definitely use a bit of
optimization though
but I was able to successfully connect
to a surfer
unfortunately the audio quality was oops
you'll want to make sure that hardware
switch is enabled what yes I can hear
you can you hear me I'm recording this
conversation just so you know officer
and it is working and we have voice chat
over tcp/ip actually it may be UDP IP
but we have voice chat over a mumble not
telephony right now so at the very least
you'll be able to chat with anyone you
can convince to connect to a mumble
server when it came time to flash the
deaf kit we found the old version of you
you you no longer worked this force us
to recompile a new version of uuu if
you're on Debian you might be able to
get away with just upgrading that uuu
package post reflash it's nice to see
that the usage app is included by
default I quite like the way that it
visualizes which directories are eating
up all your data
connecting to Wi-Fi works without issue
as long as that hardware switch is
enabled and it eliminates the need for
me to have to run on Ethernet court so
that's quite convenient
taking a look at the browser it seems
usable you can get around and find
whatever you might want to look up for
example this is a Libre five hack
session from Wade's point of view I
really do appreciate his work and he's
been hosting the Libre five hack
sessions which is where I've been
getting most of my footage and takes
place every two weeks so big shout out
and thanks to Wade on the heavier pages
you might be better off with a dedicated
gtk application but possibly more
development time will make this smooth
in the browser I also gave Firefox ago
it installed just fine and scrolling
works if you can manage to hit that tiny
scrollbar a simple config tweak in
Firefox would allow for touch scrolling
but unfortunately the input doesn't map
correctly so the keyboard is just like
inputting random crap
up until now the power or lock button
didn't do much unless you held it down
but now it locks the screen unlocking
the screen seems to struggle I messed
around with this for a bit just because
it was entertaining I was kind of hoping
that if I locked and unlocked it enough
times that the screen would eventually
realign up but this does not seem to be
the case a reboot or restarting Fache
was needed in order to correct the issue
talk about a colorful bug it'd be
interesting to know if this affects a
Libra 5 phone as well as the dev kit the
keyboard has more options you can add
other languages in the settings and then
switch between them in the keyboard I
think a USA Terminal layout would be
nice
something with tab and control initially
the store page did not populate but once
I ran apt-get update in a terminal it
did populate just fine I also ran into a
weird bug where if you've told it to
install an app and then you hit cancel
it assumes that the package is installed
but cannot uninstall or reinstalled
package but if it does get in this weird
state you can just app to install
whatever in a terminal as for app
development I did see an interesting
behavior in Fache if your window size
becomes too big parts of the screen will
get cut off but once the screen can be
resized back down it does
on the desktop if it becomes too big the
app will stay big until manually resized
I just thought this was some cool
self-correcting behavior so when
shipping batches got announced
impatience got the better of me and I
bought a second labrum five from handle
turns out both of the devices will be in
evergreen so I'm giving one away to this
fine community to enter the labor 5
giveaway leave a comment below of how
you would use the labrum 5 if you had
one then I'll assign a number of entries
based on how cool the idea is as long as
you plan to use the labrum 5 you'll get
at least one entry in the giveaway in
the end I'll use some sort of random
program to pull a winner
come Q to 2020 I expect the device will
fill a lot smoother and finally be ready
to take its place as a primary device
thanks for watching bye
