phone agent build me an app so I can use
my phone as a keyboard and have an
option to select an ISO and do USB Mass
Storage emulation you'll need to buy a
Linux phone before we can proceed shall
I order one for you yes please the app
bottleneck for mobile Linux is coming to
an end but not in the way you might
expect instead of downloading apps from
a store imagine asking your phone to
track your Garden's growth and to
suggest watering based off of weather
data seconds later you get that exact
app tailored to your particular needs
this isn't Science Fiction it's the near
future of mobile Computing AI systems
already understand Linux development
Having learned deeply from millions of
open-source projects now they're ready
to put that knowledge to work by
generating apps on demand AI you have
just read all of the internet you can
code in any language in any
language now it's finally time for your
user prompt
right IOS
app initially these app generators will
need to be run on powerful servers
similar to how chat GPT works today even
so there are already open-source models
that are powerful enough to get the job
done today here's looking at you R1
you'll describe what you need AI will
generate the app and deploy it to your
phone and Linux phones are perfectly
positioned for this because they can run
any code the AI generates without
artificial platform restrictions
as AI models become more efficient and
mobile processors more powerful this
generation process will move directly
onto the phone your Linux phone will
become its own development environment
able to create and modify apps on the
Fly IOS and Android were not designed
for this sort of flexible on device
development but Linux phones are mobile
computers with full development
capability the same tools that work on
Linux desktop work on Linux phones
giving AI a complete Workshop to create
what you need right when you need it
I expect this shift to On Demand app
generation will make Linux phones
incredibly attractive an AI assistant is
only as good as the tools it has access
to and Linux has a lot of tools if you'd
like to see me try to build such a
system leave a comment below and I'll
see what I can do thanks for watching
bye okie dokie
