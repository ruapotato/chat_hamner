it seems clear that around March 2020
anyone that wants to pick up a Linux
powered smartphone will have two options
the pine phone is a hell of a bargain
coming in at only a hundred and fifty
dollars while the Lieberman five is
expected to have higher build quality
performance and security both companies
clearly love Linux but they went about
developing a Linux powered device a bit
differently peers incent deaf kids to
anyone that paid for one plus a few
given out to the community eventually
Pyne 64 on the other hand gave
development kits to people with proven
OS development backgrounds they were not
available for people in the media or
Linux enthusiasts it appears a model was
nice because it allowed me to follow
nearly the entire process of bringing
pure OS to the deaf kit while early Pyne
phone videos are few and far between but
providing hardware to open-source
developers is a proven model people
donate hardware to open-source projects
all the time
Pyne 64 is now solving the lack of
exposure by releasing the Braveheart
edition of the pine phone which is
available for order at the moment the OS
is that run on the device are still beta
and it will not come pre-installed with
any OS this is amazing for people like
me I can check out a number of os's that
are coming to the pine phone even before
one is fully usable Pearson on the other
hand is sending the early versions of
their device to the backers who ordered
first there is nothing wrong with this
except I likely won't have good access
to peers and hardware until our dish
if you live near Portland Oregon and are
in an early batch feel free to contact
me I would love to record your phone and
get your impressions of what it's like
to use like Apple Pearson has complete
control of the hardware and software on
the labrum v this puts a lot on their
plate they have to design and build
working hardware as well as port PR OS
to the phone this allows them to create
a new ecosystem around peer OS and the
Libra meone services that has to be good
for business
while behind 64 has largely handed off
the software side of things to the
community which lets them focus on
building good hardware but it also means
that they will be adopting a current or
upcoming mobile Linux ecosystem the
Libra 5 wins the freedom contest they
are shooting for the respects your
freedom certification which no phone has
today while the Libra 5 still has some
binary blobs that need removed the pine
phone is going to be relying on these
proprietary blobs in the kernel for you
boot for DRAM initialization power
management Wi-Fi and baseband the Libra
5 takes another step towards freedom and
security they separate that baseband
from the main CPU and RAM that way the
baseband on your phone can't poke around
your running app data is a great idea
why are we writing desktop applications
and phone apps the Libra 5 and lip handy
is the first to try to merge what runs
on the Linux desktop 2 what runs on the
Linux phone if this ends up being even
slightly popular in the open source
world a massive collection of ported
software and new software will spring up
on the phone and on the desktop it's not
like I pull up my sailfish OS app on my
desktop ever not because I don't want
you either
it's because they haven't freaking open
sourced all the UI components shame plus
they aren't adaptive so they wouldn't
look quite right on a desktop anyway
however I could see myself pulling open
a app designed for the leap from 5 on my
desktop or even plugging in my labrum 5
into a monitor and using it as a desktop
using leap from five apps on a standard
Linux desktop might be a bit challenging
up until lip handy being up streamed
then it'll be entirely trivial come q2
2020
I expect the pine phone will have more
OS options while the leap from five will
have an officially supported Debian
based pure OS and a growing list of
alternative os's I have to say though
the list of OS is that already run on
the pine phone is impressive if you left
your Nokia Linux device Maemo less toe
can be installed you should totally
check out mammal éstos channel
it makes me miss my n900
there is also an actor
sailfish OS the webOS successor loon OS
is also installable check out Kristof's
channel for more on that
one of the best
options is definitely post-market OS
check out Martin Brahms channel for more
on that he also has videos on ubi ports
on a pint phone death kit more videos
are definitely needed I would love to
see a video of kte nyan Debbie and bass
on this device for example over the past
two weekends I've been working on an
automation app called triggers the idea
is to create a app like Tasker but fork
and new Linux phones I'm trying to keep
the dependencies down so that it can be
easily ported or installed on just about
any Linux OS add a trigger and at least
one action
then you create an event which group
one trigger and one or many actions
at the moment trigger scripts and action
scripts are working and I'm working on
mock-ups for the time-based triggers
compared to making the same app on
Android I would say it's about a
thousand times better writing in Python
gtk than Java so yeah I cannot wait for
my brave heart pine phone and my Libra 5
to arrive thanks for watching bye
