hello and welcome many of you wanted to
know what it's like to daily Drive
Mobile Linux on a phone so I installed
postmarket OS on my pixel 3A here's my
experience of what it's like daily
driving mobile Linux let's start with
the good stuff postmarket OS has some
really cool build scripts that lets you
build a custom image for your device
with your packages pre-installed also
with a customized username and password
definitely an interesting approach that
gives you a tailored image just for you
once the image was built the actual
process to flash the 3A was pretty
straightforward and easy out of the box
there were some useful apps as well as a
lot of customization ability the
interface is actually pretty decent it's
clean mostly responsive and feels
natural if you're coming from the gome
desktop this whole ecosystem is evolving
with things like plasma mobile also
being available for developers and power
users postmarket OS is truly magical
offering a full Linux experience in your
pocket need to SSH into a server no
problem want to build a python or rust
application go for it it you get the
full flexibility of the Linux ecosystem
all in your pocket okay now for the
tough part actually using this as a
phone with postmarket OS is really rough
the phone modem randomly disappears call
Quality is incredibly questionable and
the battery life is much worse than it
was with Android I even had an
experience where I was waiting for an
important phone call and during the
phone call the modem dropped requiring a
full reboot to bring it back up this was
brutal completely unacceptable cable and
ended up being the reason I flashed back
to
Android now I hate my phone this
operating system is completely rubbish
I'll never write a program for it but it
gets calls really reliably and I only
charge it like maybe twice a week
another big issue with a pixel 3A
running post Marco OS is you have to
select between 2G which can receive
calls and 4G which can use data but not
receive calls so you have the option of
using 4G data or being able to receive
and send calls so if you're actually
trying to use your phone as a phone it
can't use mobile data camera quality
took a huge hit it went from looking
absolutely gorgeous to looking like it
was shot in
480p with postmarket OS you can expect
about a day of battery life which is
usable but without postmarket OS running
Android it can last up to a week GPS fun
fun ality was also broken on my 3A I
couldn't get a fix on my position with
gnome Maps or pure Maps so don't get
lost with this device the best you can
do is pull up a map of your area if you
know where you
are the app situation on postmarket OS
is actually pretty impressive pretty
much every app I wanted to install was
there in their store one notable
exception was God dot here's the bottom
line as a telephone it's terrible as a
cool Linux device it's amazing if you're
if you're in the market for a cool Linux
device absolutely give it a look but if
you're looking for something that can
reliably pick up a call this is not it
it was a lot of fun daily driving
postmarket OS on my pixel 3A and I plan
on testing out other Linux devices in
the future if that kind of thing
