recently I decided to invest in the
purism libram five phone and I'm
ridiculously excited for this device I
decided to check out the software stock
they've created so far instead of using
the default gnome shell like originally
planned they've they've created this
shell called polish which by default is
packaged for Debian but I also found
packages in the openSUSE repository it
looks like they use Jenkins to build
nightly builds whatever the latest stuff
is so go ahead and download whatever the
latest is run this command to convert it
to something VirtualBox can read or use
KBM or whatever the hell they want you
to do VirtualBox is just easy though but
do note that VirtualBox has this weird
resolution issue where everything is not
quite a phone screen size my guess is
that is what's causing a lot of these
rendering issues starting up it looks
like any other grub x86 distribution of
course the phone's gonna look different
on startup it's gonna have some other
bootloader on the actual Lee brim 5 this
is the swipe lockscreen and the default
pin is one two three four five six seems
pretty basic
oh hell there's a rotate option switch
to normal perfect alright so the top
panel is just that basic drop down on
the phone I'm assuming it's just gonna
take up most of the top there so do note
that this is gonna be a much smaller
screen so I'm assuming you'll click on
one of these things and it'll switch to
a whole new display the back button or
something like that
but since it's this weird resolution
that hasn't been tested much it's kind
of screwing up the format I'm assuming
but you can definitely get the idea of
what they've created and added it's very
gnome like gnome settings spread out in
almost a Android interface way it's cool
to see this high contrast is holy but I
mean legible large text I'm actually
pretty impressed with these usability
tools if you have a hard time seeing you
can definitely turn these up
however the cursor size is not super
relative for a phone I'm curious to know
what the screen reader does I couldn't
get it to function but that could be
interesting text-to-speech possibly now
I couldn't get the zoom options to work
either I don't know if that's a
VirtualBox issue or what so we'll just
have to wait and see on that but my
guess is that you can get like a fisheye
lens zoom effect which would be pretty
cool especially if you can add like a
tap and hold fisheye effect also do note
that the Libra my phone is
be 5.7 inches which if you look at other
5.7 inch phones that's gonna be pretty
pretty hefty so theoretically this could
be a godsend to someone who needs a
phone with large text high contrast zoom
effects screen readers so it's got some
really interesting promise here
holy actual hell that keyboard is ugly
please please PLEASE infest time on
theming the keyboard that is definitely
the ugliest thing I've seen in a while I
really have no idea what all these
typing assistant and options do or are
for they didn't seem to change much once
again I don't think a cursor is gonna
really be that important once we get to
the actual labrum 5 phone touch
interface I don't know about this are we
gonna be double tapping to right-click
essentially on our phone what are we
gonna be doing hover click that could be
interesting you know for a phone focused
on privacy it's kind of hilarious to see
Google at the top of this
screen lock interesting locations off by
default usage and history on ooh trash
files interesting now these sound
settings look just like the gnome ones
which to be honest is kind of awesome
friend okay
yeah audio is working Oh
these power settings seem way more
fitting on a desktop than a phone you're
gonna have my phone screen on for five
minutes and then turn off please no
suspend the phone suspend quote-on-quote
I don't think so I hope they had some
standby options and like ooh promise of
a VPN very good now if only I could
change the resolution to an arbitrary
number and get it close to the EEPROM
five sighs this is an interesting
feature theoretically we can make the
screen more orange or blue depending on
the time of day keyboard shortcuts again
this seems more fitting for a desktop
class desktop instead a phone that has
no physical keyboard
how about touch screen settings no okay
this will be much more complex in the
future I'm sure Thunderbolts interesting
and I'm assuming this is all of the apps
at the moment I wasn't able to find an
app drawer so these are the only ones I
was able to find the ones under
favorites maybe I'm doing something
wrong but it does give us a good test
sample anyway
let's create a bob
arbitrary data great data how about some
arbitrary data oh okay the thing is at
the top he's my favorite okay well I'm
assuming it'll be easy to call this
person eventually phone dialer looks
like a phone dialer no complaints there
huh
on
I'm not really sure what that's gonna
look like here's the calendar looks
pretty good event okay that's pretty
easy straightforward and I like it
okay file browser feels just like the
gnome one perfect
okay don't open the FS tab with document
viewer I don't really know any PDFs are
so moving on okay let's take a look at
the browser not bad good default I mean
it looks solid so far oh I don't know
phone and click on any of these let's
play this video
oh that video hello everyone over the
thousands of years our planet has been
invaded
okay
it's smooth enough now that doesn't tell
us anything about how good it's gonna
perform on the actual phone but looks
like a good base looks pretty solid
check out the terminal all right we got
ourselves nice debian-based distribution
terminal is obviously the gnome one and
because of that it's a solid terminal
okay the root password is one two three
four five six
just like the pin I'm curious to know if
they keep those synced on purpose
alright the repository seemed to
function so solid terminal yep that's
about all I could find in this build I'm
sure they'll be more every day thanks
for watching
