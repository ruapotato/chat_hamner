hello and welcome back everybody I'm
gonna give you a quick rundown on how to
kill those pesky processes that just
don't want to die so for example let's
have Kate here's just a simple text
editor and it closes fancy-dancy
but let's go ahead and stop Kate with
ctrl Z okay so longer working properly
it's pretty much frozen there's a couple
ways we can try killing this process way
one is kill all kill all and the process
name that'll kill all instances of Kate
I only have one so that would be a valid
way to do it
now notice Kate's not dead what do you
do if kill all has failed well you can
pass in a signal to kill and kill all -
9 is the most nasty signal you can pass
in if - 9 doesn't work you're better off
rebooting than trying to continue to
kill the process but we'll go ahead and
kill - 9 that and you can see that it
did kill the process and you you know
notice when I hit enter my job control
tells me you done killed Kate another
way to do this is with just plain old
kill will do the same thing freeze Kate
but this time we're gonna find the pig
probably the easiest way to find the pig
is with top um if you've got a if you're
trying to find something that uses a lot
of CPU definitely tops the easiest way
but for us Kate's not taking very much
CPU so PS will do what we want
so PSU ax is what I always pass in I
grep so this is printing out a process
table and we're piping that process
table into grep and we're gonna search
for whatever so in this case Kate
obviously both of these lines are
irrelevant
the one we're looking for is this top
one it's almost always gonna be the top
one so this is our pit we can now type
in kill and that pit and this is the
same thing as kill all at this point and
look it did the same thing and we can
also because it didn't work passed in a
- 9 and we get we done killed it all
right and another useful way to kill a
process especially a graphical process
is with ex kill so we'll go ahead and do
the same thing put him in the background
but this time we're gonna actually make
him run and we'll just pretend he's
broken it was Kate broken we're gonna go
to the a console make sure you can still
see Kate when you run this command and
type in X kill you'll notice your cursor
changes to a little crossbones
careful what you click on anyway click
on your broken application and it will
kill it
that's the last way I'm going to show
you how to kill process thanks for
watching
you
