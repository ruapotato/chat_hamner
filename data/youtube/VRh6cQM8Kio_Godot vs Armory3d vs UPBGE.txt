I tested three open- Source game engines
here's what I learned from the fastest
option to the option with the best
graphics in Armory 3D up Blender Game
engine and gdau I created roughly the
same 3D game based on the gameplay of
Boulder 2D Boulder 2D is a simple Zerg
game where you can grab walls jump off
walls and shoot ironically Boulder was
originally going to be 3D before the dev
scaled it down to be a 2d game Armory 3D
was the first game engine I really took
the time to learn as a developer who
writes mostly python code the node-based
logic was a big turnoff for me I always
considered any graphical language to be
less powerful or not worth my time after
learning Armory I was proved wrong it's
actually a very powerful if a bit clumsy
programming format once you understand
what the nodes do wiping out a bit of
game logic with just a few nodes can be
very fun what ultimately drove me away
from Armory was the bugs one such bug is
is I can't seem to get sound workking
without resorting to building a full
release of the game but when you do
build the game the performance is
excellent I mean just look at this game
playay here's 100 enemies and Armory has
no issue with all those Ai and Laser
balls 200 is too much but I bet you
could get even more with a bit of tuning
the graphics are okay but they're not as
good as other engines I tested models
inside of blender tended to look a lot
different in game resulting in a lot of
time tuning
Armory 3D has the best set of exportable
platforms from the web to console to
mobile this has you set up next I gave
the up Blender Game engine a go I
decided to use logic nodes inside of up
Blender Game engine because they were
similar to Armory with one massive
Advantage these nodes can execute Python
scripts that can do anything within your
game one downside to the up Blender Game
engine nodes is logic seems to be forced
to be handled per frame rather than add
a trigger compared to Armory 3D the
nodes are clumsy and a bit harder to use
but they're still
effective another big advantage to up
Blender Game engine is the ability to
use geometry nodes these can come in
handy for things like terrain
generation performance seems to be
completely usable for smaller numbers
but at around 30 AIS the game really
starts to struggle though bits could be
redone in a more efficient way the
performance is what drove me to look for
something else because this is built
directly into blender and utilizes the
blender rendering framework the games
look just how you made them modeling the
graphics in up Blender Game engine is
the best of all three game engines I
tested the big downside is the complete
lack of 2D tools like basic buttons and
menus in other words you have to use 3D
assets to build out your menus exporting
is limited you can run your games on Mac
windows and Linux next I tested gdau my
main reason for avoiding gdau was
because of the use of GD script
I wanted to write python codee or No
Deal fortunately working with the other
game engines broke me of my stubbornness
so I swallowed the GD script shaped pill
after using GD script I realized why the
developers of gdau made it instead of
using a pre-built option like python or
Lua GD script is built for games vectors
colors and game objects are first class
while everything is still objectoriented
the keyword self is nowhere to be seen
as it's implied by being attached to a
game object GD script is just like
python if python were Rewritten for
gamedev gdau was the fastest of all the
engines I tested buttery smooth gameplay
with normal numbers of AIS and it can
handle 100 AIS just
[Music]
fine like with Armory 200 was about the
limit I already have a few ideas on how
to limit the number of active script
which could increase the AI count a lot
Graphics are on par with up Blender Game
engine but with a disadvantage of things
looking slightly different when imported
from other other tools like blender gdau
lets you export to Mac Windows Linux
mobile and the web better than up
Blender Game engine but not as good as
Armory 3D overall I had a lot of fun
learning these engines Armory is a good
starting place and has excellent node
logic perfect for someone hesitant to
dive into programming but still wanting
to learn Game Dev Armory also has a very
good set of export platforms the up
Blender Game engine has all the power of
blender and python at your fingertips
perfect for a python fanatic like I used
to
be gdau is well-rounded with decent
performance perfect for making bigger
games gdau also has a lot of community
plugins some of which are crazy amazing
like always this is free software and
