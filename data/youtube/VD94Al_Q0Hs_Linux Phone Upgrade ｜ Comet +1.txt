hello and welcome Mecca just had a live
stream covering a bunch of updates
they're putting in their mobile Linux
device and now it's a phone and it's got
an npu let's cover the highlights the
biggest news is a complete platform
upgrade they're moving from the imx8
mini to the imx8 plus it's still a quad
core CPU but it has some nice upgrades
with this platform Improvement the GPU
gets a nice boost this GPU supports
openg glees 3.1 and Vulcan kind of right
now the open source drivers support
openg glees 2.0 and Mecca is actively
working with the open source Community
to get Vulcan and a newer version of
openg running memory and storage is
getting a nice upgrade too from 4 gigs
of RAM to 8 gigs of RAM and from 32 gigs
of onboard storage to 64 pretty nice
they also have support for an SD card in
case you want to Chuck in a couple extra
terabytes but here's where things get
really interesting they've upgraded
their pcie slot to 3.0 and changed the
keying to b key this means you can plug
in a proper modem and there's more space
around the modem meaning the support for
modem should be better than the libram 5
okay now for the display technology
they've switched to AMOLED which looks
gorgeous but does potentially suffer
from Burnin so you got to be careful not
to like leave a terminal up for hours on
end they managed to make the device
thinner going from 16 mm down to 14 mm
but they had to cut the ethernet port
they also changed the USB ports to USBC
ports on the front front they removed
the male Pogo pins and replac them with
female pins which will be much more
durable on the device itself this way
the modules will have mail pins and if
there's any damage to those mail pins
it'll be on the module and not the phone
protecting the phone from potential wear
to handle all this amazing new hardware
they manage to squeeze in a battery
that's 30% bigger they're projecting
that this will take the battery life
from 4 to 5 hours to 6 to 7 hours now
here's the catch this is going to drag
out the timeline sum they're projecting
first prototypes will land in May and
they're being smart about their
Kickstarter launch they want to wait
until they can demonstrate working
Hardware the price will also be
increased compared to what they
originally projected I think they said
something like 30% potentially this has
truly become a successor to the libr 5
outperforming its processor and adding
in additional capabilities like the
modular hardware and an npu not to
mention that it has extra space around
the modem so additional modems will be
easier to drop in the first iteration of
the developer dock are live and it takes
you all the way through building their
kernels and flashing their device CAD
files are published and source code is
available on their GitHub they are going
to send out some of their prototype
devices the same version that was at CES
but they don't have that many as it is a
prototype build still I'm hoping I'll be
one of the ones they send a device to
this is much more than just a spec bump
they've completely redesigned their
device around Community feedback while
I'm a bit bummed about the timeline I'd
rather they take their time rather than
rush out a half-baked product what do
you think about all these upgrades let
me know in the comments below thanks for
watching bye
