let's go over the wallet calculator
project from Codecademy alright
step 1 set up a variable called meal and
set it to forty four point five okay 54
point five zero set up some tax tags
gets six point seven five divided by 100
now that's not exactly how I would do
this calculation so we're gonna do it
two ways the way that they're trying to
have us be taught and the most common
way I'll add and in the crazy way that I
want to do it so tax one is just gonna
be six point seven five no divided by
100 we'll use it later okay and then
we're gonna set up for two 'ti fifteen
percent and do note that I purposefully
put a decimal in there this is Python 2
we want to force float division instead
of integer division actually it's not
Python to base at all it's kind of being
interpreted to JavaScript on this
website so it's it's fine but it's kind
of like Python two in that in the sense
that it likes to do integer division
when integers are given okay so now
we're gonna do it my way
tip just gets 15
so then we're going to modify the mule
variable to include the tax so you'll
get mule loss the result being plucked
by text that will adjust the mill
variable to include d tax then there's
the way that I'm gonna do it
that's nothing like the way they would
have you do it which is all our gets
forty four point let's just do panel
divided by all members so break up the
middle cost into 100 parts and then pull
out six of those parts makes more sense
to my brain there's six point seven five
so then we can do they'll get you know
plus male part x tax one which is the
six point seven five value okay and then
so these two lines is kind of equivalent
to their one-liner
so I guess my ways inefficient and bad
but whatever now for their way they want
and you'll get what do we put total
total get meal
in Pentheus by the way the parentheses
are just for me I think it's prettier
order of operations would do the
multiplication first anyway but it is
definitely prettier this way and it's
just going to be you know x tax and we
don't like that way so yep my way you
have to update mill part right here then
we can do me and gets an ax whole gets
meal loss yeah our x our tip swift a
print out the total save that and that
is the value we were hoping for
so fifty four point six two
let's go ahead and prove that their way
works too so comment out this this and
make that this this and that well this
is supposed to be a tip so we'll just
modify that and this is supposed to be
tip one so well update that it's
or stress fun
