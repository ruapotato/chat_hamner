selfish OS is the best mobile Linux
operating system to date let's compare
it to the Libra 5 development kit of
course the Libra 5 has yet to ship so
this comparison is a little bit unfair
and of course I'll post updates once
they become relevant let's talk about
hardware the most spec - plus this
device has 6 gigabytes of RAM and an
octa-core 2.2 gigahertz cortex a53
processor compared to the leap from 5
dev kit which has 3 gigabytes of RAM and
a quad-core 1.5 gigahertz cortex a53
processor and of course Pierrot s is a
Debian based system and sailfish OS is
an RPM based distribution when using lip
zip under the hood to install packages
and one using dpkg
under the hood as far as battery
capacity these two devices are more or
less equal so it'll be really
interesting to compare battery life once
the actual libre mon releases now that
we have the specs out of the way let's
compare boot time
[Music]
there it is with literally half the
specs the Libre five dev kits still
booted a few seconds faster of course
these are Linux devices we're going to
want to see what the terminal is like to
use peer ISM has recently switched to
Kings Cross for the terminal application
and selfish OS has been using finger
term for quite a while the biggest
difference is the keyboard finger term
has a built-in keyboard that's unique to
just finger term it doesn't appear
anywhere else on the device and has lots
of very useful terminal input on the
other hand Kings Cross uses a standard
application keyboard I'm hoping that
peer ISM will do something like sailfish
OS here and include a dedicated keyboard
just for the terminal or perhaps a way
to switch between different keyboard
layouts one useful for desktop commands
and control and all that jazz and one
useful for applications I want to type a
text message to my mom
type thing here's a close-up of the
application keyboard these things are
identical one of the new added features
of this keyboard is the ability to enter
a slash this enables you to use regular
IRC and a terminal
let's go ahead and compare the browsers
on simple pages scrolling seems to work
fine on both browsers
Wikipedia no issue at all I guess there
is this weird bug in the Li from five
browser where if you're over some
elements you can't flick around to
scroll quite as well
let's take a look at some images that
seem to have loaded just a tad bit
faster on the dev kit but we can start
singing the scrolling joke a bit it
seems like the Libra 5 is really fast at
the initial rendering of the page but if
there's too much content on the actual
page scrolling can get choppy
video playback isn't exactly smooth on
the labrum five but it does seem to work
just fine on the selfish OS device
also fullscreen seems to not function as
well
closing the web browser
possible on the labrum five so we can
take a look at how to do that on each of
them
the dialer app they are nearly identical
they have three basic categories a
dialer category history / recent
category and a people / contacts
category
let's take a look at what the labrum v
has to uniquely offer the phone will
offer three hardware kill switches and a
lockdown mode one of the switches will
control the camera and microphone one
for the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and one for
the cellular baseband if you activate
all three switches it puts the phone in
a lockdown mode
this disables not only the camera
microphone Wi-Fi Bluetooth cellular
baseband but also disables the GPS
accelerometer ambient light and
proximity sensors it's also important to
note this is done on a hardware level
power is literally cut from these
devices this leaves you with a still
working phone
well portable Linux dinging with a
screen that can talk to anything the
Libra 5 can also natively run X 11 and
Wayland while selfish OS relies on a
compatibility layer called Hybris Hybris
loads Android libraries and overrides
some symbols from Bionic with G live sea
calls making it possible for Bionic
based software such as Android only
binary blobs to be loaded on G live sea
based Linux distributions in addition to
that Hybris can also translate android
egl calls into Wayland eg o calls
allowing Android graphic drivers those
stupid blobs to be loaded on Wayland
based systems
that's where sailfish OS steps in it
uses this Wayland based system to
display all of its graphics this Hybris
stack has been the most popular mobile
linux platform for a long time now and
I'm very happy to see it go
so without the need to use Hybris we can
ditch a lot of the complex crappy stack
that sailfish OS is forced to use along
with so many other mobile Linux
distributions this is a massive shift in
how mobile Linux is handled allowing for
much easier porting of OSS
a potentially interesting upcoming
feature of the labrum 5 is this
so-called no carrier phone of course the
labrum 5 like any phone will be able to
use a SIM card and make normal calls and
text messages however this is likely not
the only way you can make calls on the
labrum 5 combined with libra mile a
future part of the labrum 1 bundle the
basic idea is you transfer your phone
number to leave room dial the service
will provide calling an SMS over a
network connection this can take a
couple of forms a Wi-Fi only phone or a
Wi-Fi + cellular data phone of course to
use cellular data you're gonna go need
to pick up a data only phone plan from
t-mobile or AT&amp;T which is actually
fairly cheap like 20 bucks a month at 8
bucks on top of that for the libra one
service and you're good to go you can
make calls anywhere that you can receive
a data connection plus 28 bucks a month
is not bad for a phone bill I should
also mention purism is very good at up
streaming what I mean by this is the
work that peer ISM does is less work for
everyone else wanting to build a Linux
phone the peers own price tag represents
a shift in the Linux phone community if
the price is too high great weight and
pick up a pine phone after the community
has finished developing a lot of
packages around mobile Linux or you can
go ahead and buy a labrum 5 and support
the mobile Linux software stack and be
one of the first on this new kind of
phone as a side note frozen bubble
almost works on the dev kit a few small
changes to the UI and it would work
great touchscreen input isn't working
and if you wanted to control with the
keyboard the arrow keys are missing
while the physics engine seems to work
flawlessly the game is technically
unplayable due to the lack of input kind
of a cool distraction I was also able to
test my audiobook player on the Libra 5
dev kit and of course it's working great
playing things fast or slow hooray
so there's $700 worth it should you buy
a Libra 5 well I think that comes down
to how much you want to see mobile Linux
succeed if the Leiberman 5 is a success
than the pine phone and many other Linux
devices will likely also succeed thanks
for watching bye
