hello and welcome back everybody so I
know it's been a few days since I've
made a video but my computer's still
being utilized I'm training a neural net
a deep dream on fractals once that's
done I should have some pretty
interesting output of deep dream mask
fractals we'll see what happens
until it's done standby
[Music]
[Applause]
you
