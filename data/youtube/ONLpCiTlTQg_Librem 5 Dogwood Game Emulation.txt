the quad-core CPU and powerful GPU can
play SNES games easily after tweaking
the graphics settings and sound settings
to not use vsync snes9x seems to use G
TK 3 which is natively displayed in
Weiland this is cool because you can use
the on-screen keyboard to interact with
the game in this demo I'll be using this
Bluetooth keyboard this Auto connects
quite quickly after the first pairing
Super Mario World plays very well I'll
test attaching a controller at some
point this would also be a good
opportunity for someone to make an
onscreen controller for squeak board
directions to get started could be found
on this blog and 64 emulation works very
well on the leapin 5 a few frames are
dropped now and then but for the most
part it plays at full speed for some
reason the pause menu is rather slow but
it does eventually pop up a few times
while is messing around with other
applications the graphics ended up
becoming corrupt quite simple to fix
just restart the app a bug with a
default keyboard makes it so that the
keys mismatch in ex Wayland windows
while that bug is being worked on
you can simply swap out virtual
keyboards or use a Bluetooth keyboard
like I am here overall I'm really
impressed with what this computer shaped
phone can do as time goes on this kind
of thing will become simple to set up
and enjoy thanks for watching bye
