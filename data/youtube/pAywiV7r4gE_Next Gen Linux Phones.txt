it's no secret that the libram 5 and
pine Fones have been the best hardware
to run mobile Linux on for the last few
years but that's quickly changing let's
take a look at what new devices are
coming down the pipeline to kick things
off let's start with things you can
already buy Fury Labs has the flx1 which
is an Android handset that's been
reshaped into a Linux device this uses
helium to bridge the driver Gap but that
also means that you're stuck running
Android kernels which will in turn limit
the overall lifespan this device is
capable of even stuck on a single kernel
this could last a very long time given
the proper software support its specs
are no joke running 6 gigs of RAM 128
gigs of storage and a uh octe
processor okay now for the big caveat of
this device if you're in the United
States it probably won't have the best
cell reception while not exactly a phone
the U console from clock work is a
mobile Linux device that can have a
modem so in theory you could turn this
into a mobile Linux device albe it a
chunky one this puppy is powered by a
Raspberry Pi compute module so you have
an option for what CPU and RAM you want
to install with this kind of modularity
it is possible that later down the road
you could upgrade the compute module
with something even
better pretty cool the next few phones
we're going to talk about are pre-
crowdfunding so keep in mind that these
may never come to fruition although
although I hope they do the lick next is
a true successor to the libram 5 it
Sports a very similar look and feel
including Hardware kill switches but the
specs are completely Next Generation
this baby has an octacore processor 32
gigs of RAM and
256 gigs of onboard storage
awesome very similar to the libram 5
this will be using a Debian based
distribution and running the fos user
interface this company seems to be
taking open source and Hardware design
seriously I truly wish these guys
success in their crowdfunding Venture
the Mecha Comet takes a leaf out of the
libram 5's Playbook and uses an nxp
processor in this guy it's a 1.8 GHz
processor which should be a nice stepped
upgrade to the libram 5 what makes this
guy truly interesting is the full-size
USB as well as the modular front
connection with this device you can have
a dedicated controller thumb keyboard or
even build a robot keep keep in mind
though this device will not be thin
especially with its attachments while
this would be a nice upgrade to the
libram 5 it wouldn't be a dramatic
Improvement like the next saish OS by
Yola is one of the best mobile Linux
distributions to date you can run it on
a variety of Sony devices if you're
willing to flash it yourself under the
hood it's very similar to what Fury Labs
is doing but instead of with a Debian
based distribution with a RPM libzip
based distribution while not not fully
open source it's still a really good
alternative so where does that put us I
predict that in 2025 some company will
outdo purism in mobile phone
contributions it should be really
interesting to see which company treats
the developers the best and provides the
most support for the longest I
personally can't wait to see where the
next and comment go and I'll get my
hands on the hardware as soon as I can
to put them through their Paces thanks
for watching bye
