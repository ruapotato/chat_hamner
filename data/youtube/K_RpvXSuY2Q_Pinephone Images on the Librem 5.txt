this guy is one of my favorite devs at
the moment he has done a lot of the
heavy lifting porting the software
piercings writing over to my favorite
distro
this sent me down a path to get opensuse
running on the labrum 5. and in the end
has created a simple way to run lots of
different distributions
big thanks to crafty guy and sebastian
who helped me work out a lot of the show
stopping bugs

i didn't start this project to be able
to run arch or debian or any other
distribution other than sueset so i
tried starting out with kiwi which is
one of the most powerful distro building
tools out there
but since setting up an arm 64
environment on opensuse was proving
harder than it should be
i went with a much more hackerish
approach grab the latest pure os image
gut it and replace most of its parts
with the root file system of some other
by hand this process looks a lot cooler
but this handy script i slapped together
does that job nicely
copy your arm 64 file system into this
directory
copy the latest library 5 image into
this directory and run the build script
this copies the library 5 image mounts
it backs up the fstab and kernel modules
deletes everything else then copies the
root file system from the other distro
runs a small bug fix and then unmounts
everything
in the end this is a simple way to mess
around with any distro that builds for
arm on the libra 5.
mobian runs fairly well the root file
system is out of storage which is
causing a bug with a display brightness
continually darkening
without disk space we cannot edit any
user settings the fix for this is
running resize 2fs
on the root file system with that done
we can now edit the user settings and
reboot the device safely
it comes with a few games 2048 which
works perfectly
and you can also play a bit of chess
files seems to work very well
but the text is a bit hard to read at
this scale
firefox comes pre-configured to work out
of the box on wayland
this does a good job while browsing on
this image you can connect to 4g
but it seems like that might have some
routing issues preventing it from
actually working right
don't push the power button if you do
the whole screen locks up and you have
to reboot
text messages work and you can make
phone calls but the speaker and
microphone don't work so you can't say
much past
the default lineup seems to work for the
most part all in all not a bad image on
the library 5.
arch linux boots i don't really know if
this version came with a gui
or if that part's broken i might play
with this a bit on the dev kit to see if
i can get some console access
nemo also boots it leaves you with this
nice looking screen
but it is rather broken at the moment
opensuse takes a minute or two to boot
but the os works well
wi-fi is broken but booting this on the
dev kit gives you access to an rj45 port
which works out of the box
just like mobian we have a lot of user
settings to mess around with
the 4g connection dialog was not what i
was expecting
and it didn't seem to work
the terminal font is a bit ugly and the
home directory is a bit bare
pressing the power button doesn't seem
to do anything i can't wait for this to
follow in the footsteps of pure os
plasma mobile memo ubuntu touch and
fedora all ended up at this screen a
workaround for this could likely be
found with a bit of effort
the fact that any of this works at all
is a testament to how robust and
interchangeable the software and
hardware purism is building
i'm happy with opensuse starting to work
if you fill up to porting to the library
5 i encourage you to take a look at this
project and chat with people on the
matrix channel
thanks for watching bye
