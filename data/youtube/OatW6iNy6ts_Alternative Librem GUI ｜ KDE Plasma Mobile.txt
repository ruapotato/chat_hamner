the official interface for the Liam five
phone will be Fache however purism has
sent several devices out to the KDE
community to help get KDE plasma mobile
working shout out to crafty guy who is
doing a lot of the work towards plasma
mobile on the labrum 5 phone he has
compiled it and even tested it on the
device there are several things that are
not working under Weiland at this point
so not only is it in pre-alpha on the
device but the VM I'll be testing is
also in pre-alpha and very crashy
I had to reboot the VM several times in
order to get this footage but let's go
ahead and take a look we're gonna ahead
and try without installing it doesn't
seem like they have Calamari's working
yet so you can't install this image but
you can certainly test it out it's
clearly based on Ubuntu 1604 and let's
look at the interface so a lot of these
panels are not working if I click
anywhere on the top panel everything
crashes there's phone app and install
our app that's not implemented camera
and an app store these squares will let
you switch between already open apps
that crashes often and the exit button
exits whatever is open well I do like
that when you open an application it
lights up the exit button letting you
know that there is an application ready
to be closed this doesn't seem to be
loading that well let's go ahead and
retry that okay and we crashed the panel
but the phone popped up so hey that's
cool umm quick overview what the phone
screens gonna look like here's the Rana
pop-up of broken connections dialog well
with the blacked out menus
I can't exit this application or really
do anything so I'm gonna have to reboot
okay now that we're rebooted let's go
ahead and try the discover store
it definitely has a lot of packages in
it so I'm assuming this has got a lot of
what is in the aboon to 16.04 store I'm
not sure if all of these have been
modified specifically to work on a phone
but they are at least easily installable
problem is I have no idea what the root
password is so the settings looks quite
nice much simpler than that in Fache and
I like some of the defaults a bit more
alright so developer mode that's pretty
cool
writable filesystem I wish Android had a
button like that and allow remote SSH
isn't letting me click it but I'm
assuming will eventually work and is
also a great feature
and here's random wireless pop-up and
here's where we can just screen
brightness lock screen sleep turn off
screen I do like that these features are
off by default but do allow you to turn
them on and Fache it felt more like they
were just kind of already on by default
now can't give them too much
because no device is actually shipped
with either of these two interfaces
working this I have to give them credit
for and is probably much better than it
will ever be in
Fache the theming it looks like they
have good QT theming working so you can
change this up I'm assuming and you'll
also be able to download additional
themes online once this has a community
behind it time and date does seem kind
of barebone but we'll give it some time
to grow V player
I wonder what V player is well got
ourselves this nice little blue thing up
okay
so home directory I can't seem to find
any videos to play in here so just
imagine that this can play videos let's
go up up up up
that's past route or above route okay
well good game I don't think I can close
this so yep that's a quick overview of
KDE plasma mobile it is not super stable
but it is getting there and it is a good
alternative to the Fache shell we
reviewed a couple weeks back I'll be
playing with the development kits more
this week and we'll be releasing another
purism video hopefully on Tuesday
