hello and welcome back everybody I'm
gonna show you how to chew root into a
different Linux operating system so I've
got a dual booted Linux system here I've
got Seuss's my host operating system
i've debian on a different partition I'm
gonna mount the root filesystem of
Debian into slash Deb
so Victor Deb if you need to all right
once that's done you can do Alice div
and you should be able to see the root
filesystem cool the simplest version of
this is for I am sis rock and then du
and then mount and you're done but um if
you want a to root the x11 works in the
commands a little bit more complicated
you need to do for I and dev dev pts
dead of SH M proc sis temp and run so
that's the first line do our bind splash
mount point slash I done alright let's
do an LS of slash deb-deb good we see
 that's good at this point we can
run to boot /r mount then from here we
can do an su - that just sets up the
root users and violent variables um you
can screw around in here and it's a
mostly working environment I can do
things anyway when you're done screwing
around with a terminal um you want x11
exit out of this and type
XOS plus and that'll allow basically
anything to connect to your x11 session
it's not super secure but it's way less
complicated for sure
anyway back into our Debian system let's
run
mate panel how about that okey-dokey
that doesn't work all the time but I
have openSUSE running down here and
Debian running up here and it's running
its route though do note it's a
different user right but to prove it
I'll go down here to system open up a
terminal and type in the cat slash
that's seized rrdl star and you can see
this is a Debian and I can even go in
here and open out in advance something
something here's Inkscape from Debian
anyway thanks for watching
