it is not easy to build a smartphone it
is even harder if you plan to ditch iOS
and Android altogether in fact it has
been tried and failed a number of times
so much is needed in order to create a
successful project of this type you need
hardware software and just as
importantly a community of dedicated
developers peer ISM is just now solving
the hardware problem by releasing the
labrum 5 a crowd of hungry Linux
developers and enthusiasts eagerly await
this device and the software has
direction and the solid base of Debian
we know what we want we know what it
will run on and we have a growing
community to do it the importance of
software direction cannot be understated
this is a genome stack running on a
standard display protocol it focuses on
convergence and security this is in
stark contrast with what lubuntu toj
tried to pull off they wanted to
reinvent a new display protocol called
mirror they also focused on unity as the
base GUI at the end of the day the Libre
5 advances the mobile Linux story while
a bone to touch mostly advanced
deprecated a boon to software however
time will tell if Obi ports can rise
from the ashes having dedicated in-house
hardware is a huge advantage Pearson has
chosen every chip that will go into the
labrum 5 which gives them an edge for
driver support and it would seem that
peer ISM is dedicated to improve and
upstream the hardware drivers this means
that other distributions that want to
use the Libre 5 hardware can take
advantage of a lot of the hard work that
peer ISM is doing replacing a mature
platform like iOS and Android does not
happen overnight much still needs done
first but the progress has been
incredible to follow in this perfect
storm of hardware direction and a
growing community let's see what peers
and managed to pull off this year so far
from horrifyingly ugly to pretty ok to
completely standard the keyboard has
seen a lot of revisions
when I first got a test out the keyboard
it was this ugly white disaster thing
but as a positive it did have a way to
press control-c escape and those other
terminal friendly keys then later we had
a much nicer themed version of this
keyboard no usability changes just a
nicer look and feel this keyboard was
eventually replaced and now we have
something that looks quite standard the
alignment is much improved and feels way
more on par with a standard smartphone
experience the only downside is the
terminal inputs are not there so no
arrow keys ctrl C or tab I'm guessing at
some point will have a way to switch
between these two different keyboards so
that we'll be able to interface with GUI
applications and terminal applications
just fine the web browser is one of the
fastest moving pieces of software
improvements and changes are common
after every update or reflash one of the
biggest changes is the improved
rendering on the small screen originally
a lot of the web pages had content cut
off this has been very much improved
where now every web site I've tested
looks very good in the mobile form
factor another big change is the
performance which continues to improve
day by day
the UI has also seen some love it is
very touch friendly and you can also
make web app shortcuts the app drawer
has also seen some incremental changes
originally the app drawer did not have
X's to close out applications and
originally it didn't display all of the
dot desktop files only displaying a
couple pre installed applications now it
displays all regular desktop files like
you would expect any menu to and of
course the performance is miles better
than it used to be here we can take a
look at the almost default gnome
settings even with this odd form factor
you can see much of the content is still
cut off on the right this is true on
most if not all of the screens somewhere
around July I was able to test on the
dev kit and they had fixed a lot of the
display issues it was still pretty
common though to get stuck with some
unadapted screen requiring like escape
on the keyboard or some touch input
that's rendered off screen as of just
about a week ago just about everything
is working fine
you
there are still a few small UI bugs but
they aren't out breaking like they used
to be
they have also added a cellular category
but I won't be able to play with this
much until I have a Libra 5 with a
working base band a lot of small yet
critical bugs have also been fixed
rotating the display with the keyboard
open used to force you to have to reboot
the device due to the keyboard being in
full screen with none of the other UI
elements being present this is no longer
the case the file selection dialog used
to be completely unusable Pearson has
done a great job porting this and it
does look right now the scrolling
framerate went from well this to a bit
more manageable speed I expect the
overall smoothness of this device to be
considerably improved over the lifetime
of the Libra 5 stability has also
improved quite a lot when I first got
the dev kit it was common for the UI to
lock up or the phone to completely power
cycle I have seen the keyboard get
messed up a random cursor appear out of
nowhere and of course that weird
keyboard bug while it does still crash
from time to time I can now develop for
hours without a crash this is a big
difference compared to how it used to be
where it would crash at least every hour
it still has a way to go but this is a
great start I also made a bit of
progress on ad box after copying and
hacking a few libraries into place we
can now see that it complains about
matching Gio lacks visuals not really
sure what that means but hey it's
progress all that in less than a year
which puts to shame the glacier like
progress of something like the Gemini
PDA I for one cannot wait to contribute
to the next modern smartphone experience
thanks for watching bye
