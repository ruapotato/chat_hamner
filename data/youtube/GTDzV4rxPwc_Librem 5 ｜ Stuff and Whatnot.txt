this is what the early version of the
launcher slash app drawer looked like it
only loaded the primary apps and left
all other dot desktop files on display
what this meant was if you installed
something new the desktop launcher would
be missing after flashing the nude FK
image this is all changed now the
launcher displays all installed desktop
files so for the first time we can see
what is pre-installed on the dev kit and
I must say some of this stuff was not
expected the first thing I thought a
little odd was there was a few redundant
applications we now have to turn elapse
Kings Cross which I'm sure will be the
default one at launch and what looks to
be the default gnome terminal when
testing with Kings Cross I noticed
something really interesting the top bar
turns red when you use sudo or switch to
the root user it also has two VIMS
surprisingly no Emacs the vim launcher
simply opens a terminal with them
running
I cannot say that's a remarkably
intuitive interface for a text editor on
your phone
Shivam is definitely a step closer but
isn't loading at the moment he calls
messaging web and contact apps are
appearing twice at the very top like
before but also down below with all the
other app launchers I was also surprised
to see known tweaks installed the menu
is clearly not using Lib handy and need
some heavy work to be usable in the
leave room 5 but it's interesting to see
it pre-installed no Maps is also
pre-installed playing with that on my
desktop has surprised me how functional
it is it can create old-school
turn-by-turn directions using
OpenStreetMaps as its data set it is a
good bet this will become the navigation
app on the Libra 5 however it does not
run on the dev kit at the moment barking
out this message
the calendar app is not perfect lots of
dates are cut off however adding an
event is very simple making it redundant
with just this little menu thing cool
chess is also included by default now
like the calendar gtk needs a little bit
of work here
ya can't really control half the board
but the AI does seem to work well and is
thoroughly kicking my ass
man I hope my old chess club buddies
don't see this it also looks like a lot
of hard work went into the background
settings here we can set the primary
background and lock screen background as
you can see setting the primary
background works very well
let's test setting a custom desktop
background just for fun we pop open a
web browser and search for whatever this
penguin with the phone looks appropriate
long tap to right-click does nothing The
View image button gives us a simple web
page with only this image loaded from
here a long tap acts as expected and
right clicks from this menu we can just
save the image as whatever we want
now that it's saved off somewhere let's
head back to the image background
settings
at the top we can hit select picture and
just navigate to where we saved off the
image the file selection dialog is
missing the select button or it's being
rendered off screen double tap does not
seem to select the image either
fortunately the keyboard saves us hit
the enter key and that selects the
picture for us I'm not sure if we have a
way to get back to an empty desktop and
show off that image without closing all
of these applications but we'll go ahead
and just close them for now and there we
go a custom background image on the leap
from 5 dev kit it still needs a little
bit of work they still need to add a few
options like tile background or stretch
background or even add black edges to
display the entire image it also seems
like the lock screen background is not
yet implemented showing just a black
screen at the moment if you saw my last
video you would know that video playback
in the web browser is not amazing at the
moment if left untouched it can have
some smooth playback but it's best just
to use em player and download the video
directly let's see how hard it is to
download a YouTube video all we need to
do is navigate to a YouTube video copy
the URL with a long tap to right click
and then we pop open to a terminal
install youtube-dl if you haven't
already then type in YouTube do space
long tap and paste that URL right back
in there so YouTube deal has no problem
running and if we type in M player in a
file name the playback is quite smooth
I'm sure in the future we'll have native
gtk applications for searching and
downloading YouTube content I also
downloaded the HD version of Nicole's
talk about the leap from v it's not only
a very good talk but it plays back on
the labrum v just fine
although I should have set the
dimensions better
in the talk we see our first glimpse of
what the PCB of the labrum 5 will look
like oh boy I hope it's that green in
the final product
this guy online took a stab at labeling
stuff on the PCB I'm pretty sure both
the headphone and the m2 Jack's are
correct pretty interesting
I installed super tux which after
installed it did appear in the menu the
game did load just fine and with the W I
could reload the in-game menu I was even
able to tap around to the application
no other normal key does anything though
if you press the key that switches
between numbers and letters it acts as
valid input in this game somehow so I
can select things in the menu and hit
the number or ABC key and it selects
that menu item anyway using this odd
input method I was able to try to start
a game
however on start the app and/or the
phone crashed every time I also loaded
up mine tests which appeared in the menu
but failed to load utterly here's a bit
of debug output I did install a few
other little games but my camera just
died so darn liked this video q3 is
almost at an end with it we can expect a
phone or delay let me know in the
comments below which you'll think it'll
be at the end of this month thanks for
watching bye
