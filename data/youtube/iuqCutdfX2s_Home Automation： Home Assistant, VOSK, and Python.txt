i've always wanted a star trek like
interface to my computer
red alert there's just something really
cool about barking orders at your
computer just to have them executed
all clear
the way i went about setting up my smart
home was with home assistant there's a
bit more to learn than with the other
hubs but nothing comes close to the
flexibility and coolness you get with
home assistant
to get started i found it best to
install an x86 computer you'll want to
install the full os or the dot devs as
this will allow you to install add-ons
for the libre mini i went with a dab
install as the full os requires a uefi
bios after you have the base install of
home assistant you can add your devices
i'm still undecided which protocol
standard is best but for now i'm using
zigbee devices with a zigbee hub
attached to my computer
as for wi-fi devices connecting
proprietary small computers to your home
network that's controlled by software
hardware and people outside your network
is dumb especially if you have unsecured
api calls bouncing around your home
network all the time i've yet to test
z-wave devices but i think it has the
same licensing issues as zigbee
all three of the common smart home
standards suck and need free software
badly
if someone can point out a wi-fi smart
device that uses open source software
please let me know i think wi-fi will be
the way forward just not this privacy
nightmare that we have going on right
now another issue with zigbee is it's
kinda slow this is one of my wake up
automations you can see each light
change color and brightness i bet if
these were wi-fi bulbs the change would
be much more in sync with each other and
much less one at a time just because
wi-fi is faster the next part my home
automation is the listening part
i use a simple vosk script constantly
listening for any words it can make out
the script then uses curl to send these
words to my core home program i'm
calling home butler home butler is a
flask program that takes these words and
builds them into a sentence each time
looking for a trigger phrase or word if
a trigger word is found it runs the
automation program for the trigger word
to make a new voice automation you add a
script with the trigger word as the name
in the voice commands folder
if the command needs multiple voice
triggers you can add an underscore
between the voice commands the scripts
themselves can import a few really handy
functions if they need it this makes it
really simple to call a home assistant
command just look up the device entity
id and find the json data you want to
send you will need to set up your api
key in settings.pi the api key can be
found here in home assistant
this means home assistant connects to
all the devices vosk listens for words
and sends them to home butler home
butler executes scripts when trigger
words are spotted
i've also added basic api triggers for
making it easy to call scripts from home
assistant this is handy if you need to
trigger an automation in-home butler
from home assistant to add a new api
call you'll want to install this file
editor plugin
then edit the config file with a new
command to call your home butler url
ending with the script you want to run
then you just need to add a script with
that name in the api folder
while my food replicator is still an
early prototype this model can already
print nice looking inedible items
the store sensor can tell when i close
the door which triggers a home assistant
automation that calls a url running on
home butler
which then sends a command to my
octoprint server to reprint the last
print in case you want to push a button
instead of talking i started work on a
web interface for home butler it's early
days but i want to make this look
somewhat star trekky like always my code
is gpl and can be found below thanks for
watching bye
