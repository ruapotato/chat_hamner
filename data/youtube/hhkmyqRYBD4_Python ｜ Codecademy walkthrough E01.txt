if you're interested in learning Python
I'm gonna start from the first lesson on
codecademy let's get started so if you
want to teach a computer to talk you use
the print statement no no no no if you
want to tell the computer to print text
you use the print statement and it's
procedural and what I mean by that is if
I do fish and I do read that it's going
to start at the top of my file and print
this and then it's going to print that
so the output of this looks looks like
this the fish and cat so I mean it's
statement is print which is a function
and that's why there are parentheses and
it takes the argument whatever you want
to say
pretty swifty I think we all get this
yeah print it's kind of like the
statement but it's it's called a
function and that's why there are these
parentheses and then it takes the
argument of a string that's why we have
in quotes something if it's in quotes
it's a string so we could also do print
like one but I strongly recommend you
don't do that because print supposed to
take string arguments not integer
arguments but it works it would be
better though the typecast and say it is
a string technically that's the clean
way to do it but don't worry about that
just yet
this green they're trying to tell you
that there's a difference between Python
two and three and they're correct but
the difference is really small and
really not that noticeable except for
the print statement back in the day if
you were writing on Python 2 which I
discourage at this point right on Python
3 but if you were to write on Python 2
you could do Lin high and that would run
fine but these days if you were to try
that it would barf out saying you forgot
your parentheses so it's a function
treat it like a function
yeah yeah yeah and then and there there
are definitely other differences in
Python 2 &amp; 3 but especially starting out
and you're not gonna notice any of them
except for print next okay so we're
going over strings in this screen which
I kind of already did but let's go over
it a little bit more that's that's a
statement it's a function because it has
these parentheses and in quotes as a
string in Python it's totally valid to
have a floating string like this you
could just have that as a line it
doesn't do anything but it's valid you
can also combine strings with the plus
symbol so hello plus space and let's do
it let's go ahead and print this to run
it so yeah you can do that and there are
reasons you would want to add strings
like this so you're gonna want to use
this every time you use variables and
you want to combine them together for
example let's go over a little bit of
variables so in Python you can store
anything basically in a variable a
variable looks like this test gets and
then something input so now test will
reference info
what does that mean it means if I put
tests right here it's the equivalent of
me putting info right here so that line
and that line are equally worthless to
the program it's like here's a floating
stream that does nothing
here's another floating stream that does
nothing print hello and then print this
let's say you want to store something
else you could store a integer like 1 or
2 or 7.3 which is now a float or a
double because it's got a decimal it's
no longer an integer or whatever
whatever you really want here you can
have a string of symbols you could name
gets David then we'll do hello plus name
this line is worthless on that that's
the most common use case for the Plus
setup the variable use it later in the
program and let's move on
okay so debugging is actually pretty
important and python has pretty good
error messages so let's go ahead and run
this
barfs this has actually happened to me
maybe a couple thousand times it's
complaining because this character and
this character the start and stop string
have to be the same so a valid way to do
this would either be single quote and
any single quote or start double quotes
and double quote
and the reason you'd want to do this is
if you want to have a single quote
inside of your text you can do it just
like that or if you want to have double
quotes inside your text you can do it
just like that now if you want to have
both you'll have to use an escape
character which is the backslash
basically that means treat the following
character differently and then you can
use the same single or double quote
inside of your text now it's going to
run this you can see the single quote is
right there so yeah you can do either of
those things
next all right so let's do a bit more on
variables named X a X 24 and then let's
do print name David is I got the
standard print statement which we're all
accustomed to and the argument we're
gonna give it is actually this and this
is gonna be executed and turned into a
single string before it's passed into
print so this is the string logic for
saying the name plus is plus the string
Erised version of page plus years old
now the reason you have to do the STR
around this it's because it's an integer
and you can't say here's this string
plus here's this integer plus here's
this string you have to say string
plucks string plucks string or integer
plus integer plus integer which is gonna
be totally different maths for example
two plus two is not four if it's a
string but if it's an integer it comes
out as four so typecasting is important
let's say we have strings and want to
treat them like integers we can just by
wrapping them with the int just like we
can wrap with a the STR if you want
strings so int 2 plus and 2 is 4 or we
can do the vice-versa where we have STR
2 plus STR of 2 is 22 that's that's
typecasting and variables yeah we did
better than this this one slide so let's
go to next oh why did you pop up that's
oh I actually have to do something
create a very both calls today's date
and assign a value that will represent
today's date to that variable okay date
and let's go to Linux for a second
there's my console x here it is
it's gotta say that huh Bay pissed wrong
well seem to like that so moving off
it's just an arbitrary string we could
have put potato in there and it would
have moved on but that's okay okay so
this is kind of interesting it's going
over how you can do addition here and
store the result of Python 3 and we can
do some subtraction on results and we
can do multiplication store that we can
do some division and store that we could
do really long nasty looking things
store that now interesting thing on the
command line Python which is the real
version if you were doing this on
command line if you run a variable with
no arguments it's going to print back
what's in that variable it's very useful
and it doesn't really do anything but
here's what I mean if I if I just type
in a variable name it's gonna spit that
out you can store that into a new one
just like that so now how do you move
are there there's equal I can even do
one gets new bar / that old one oh and
what I did did just there is tab
completion command-line does have tap
completion of variable names and
function names so I could do 1 we get 1
so yeah you can do that in their
examples they're just storing results oh
they're going over modulus module this
is pretty cool I guess that means we got
to go over integer division versus
regular divisions so let's do that now
it's where you divide something and you
get a integer back but an integer
doesn't have decimals so instead of
returning 1.6
if you typecast it to an int it's going
to concatenate set the right word no
it's going to truncate your variable so
if it's 1.9 it's still gonna be just 1
but if it's 2.1 it's gonna be to where's
this 0.6 blah blah blah blah blah
well it's you can find that with modulus
kind of so oh don't do that
if we do let's do their example 15
modulus 2 which will print 1 so you
divide 15 by 2 you're gonna have a left
over 1 because 15 is not divisible by 2
14 is divisible by 2 or any number and
then the remainder is 0 so if you want
remainders you use modulus and that's
actually pretty useful in certain
scenarios okay instructions multiply two
numbers together and assign the result
to a variable called product okay
well copy product there gets how does it
even know if I'm doing anything that it
asks it says 1 times 2 or 3 is an
acceptable like Bank look what's just
does this work does this count I just
try to be nice basically I have to do
the second part too so it wants these
numbers specifically
because that's a lame program that's a
cooler program Hey look there's actually
data cool I'm bored and tired so let's
do this another day
fun though right
