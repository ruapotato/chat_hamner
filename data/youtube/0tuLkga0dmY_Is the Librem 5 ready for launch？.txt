progress on the deaf kit has been
absolutely crazy at the moment
September 15th was the last time I had
to flash the deaf kid this leap Spears
on just nine days before the initial
launch of the Libre five after flashing
it was clear that this version was not
ready for the public for example on the
lockscreen
when you enter your PIN code the key
presses remain highlighted a bit of a
security fail we can also see the
unfinished app lineup including gnome
tweaks women vim and the non final icons
if you recall in my last video the web
browser performance is basically
unusable in certain situations there was
also no initial user setup dialog so it
didn't ask you which language you wanted
or if you want to connect any accounts
etc something newly included though is
the Software Center which had a few
glaring bugs the app section never
loaded meaning a terminal was still the
only way to install new applications
anything that prompted a user for a
password the keyboard would simply not
pop up you could copy and paste your
password and though that has its own
issues these all sound like pretty nasty
bugs right well I'm sure purism thought
so as well I did not have to reflash the
dev kit all I did was run over to the
update menu within the software Center
and hit that update button
all in all this is way cooler and much
simpler than what Android has to do in
order to modify its root filesystem
after the reboot completed the
lockscreen has seen an update key
presses are now more circular and do not
remain highlighted array once logged in
we can see one of the first versions of
the setup dialog it has some interesting
defaults
I never thought about switching to
Dvorak on a phone I doubt very much that
it would be more convenient or any
faster but I mean if you're already
accustomed to Dvorak this could be a
nice option okay cool
DoubleTap to continue or hit the next
button these gtk switches are
interesting they don't respond to
tapping you actually need to flip them
with a drag motion I did try to add a
Google account here but I don't think
that's working just yet
the moment I loaded up the Software
Center I could tell there were some
massive improvements applications and
categories are now populating just fine
let's test out installing something
k minds is not something I've tried
before so let's give it a go
they clearly fixed the password dialogue
issue where the keyboard wouldn't pop up
that's definitely good
while we wait for this to install let's
install another package I happen to know
that frozen bubble almost works so let's
go ahead and try that one
cool
it installed just fine going back to K
minds it also installed fine it also it
looks like the icons are showing up in
the menu but they don't work let's try
something that isn't a game
you
once again the icon and lodge button
don't work but running the newly
installed package from command-line
seems to function fine I really did not
expect this to run smoothly but it does
if you plug this device into a monitor
keyboard and mouse this would be a very
usable workstation to create simple
graphics this thing is running like a
champ even dragging in the menus feels
very smooth which used to jitter
sometimes
you can also do
repo management from within the software
Center
and you can even use the GUI to remove
installed packages which does seem to
function just fine okay let's take a
look at the clocks app
creating a morning alarm is very simple
and looks very nice very cool the
keyboard now supports a numpad only
layout
the stopwatch app is smooth and very
likewise the timer is perfectly usable
I'm a bit nervous to test this one the
browser
to give it the best chance let's close
everything else
the goal is to download my own
phonic
dragging around feels completely
different it's much smoother but also
stops quickly after the scroll speed
drops too low
I'll just append my username
[Music]
and here it is
I'm not sure if I can just download the
dot dev without cloning the repo so I
guess I'll just copy that and plop that
into Kings Cross
now we can just apt-get install that
package
that was not too bad but I would love to
see a community repository that is
simple to upload to and simple to add to
the phone to get phonic into Debian is
not a simple process and would be very
time consuming okay okay
what about heavy pages well it just
works the scrolling seems just fine even
on the heavy pages
video playback is also much improved
I cannot believe they have got out
working to this level before shipping
way to be amazing purism it's also nice
to see that there's just one text editor
now
the last big glaring issue I see is
newly installed applications don't have
working icons this seems like a simple
dot desktop issue and I bet Pearson will
have it fixed before the first customer
sees a Libra five phone of course this
is all still non-final software and
stuff is definitely going to change but
this gives you a pretty good idea of
what people will be using in the very
near future
thanks for watching bye
