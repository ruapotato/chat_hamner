hello and welcome back everyone I'm
going to show you how to use docker to
to root into any operating system you
desire pull up a computer and let's get
started
docker images will show you which base
images are currently installed on the
system I have a couple that I'm using
for some neural nets we're gonna go
ahead and just do a boon to you so first
step we're gonna make a directory called
the boon to and as you can see right now
I'm running Debian so my goal is to be
running it boom to you by the end of
this inside of a tree root so darker
pull preventing that's this is an
official tag so it's pretty easy to
download and it's supported and
maintained by those docker folks now I
need to start an instance of the base
docker image talk along kicked in boom -
alright so this is down inside of the
docker image and you can see it is
Ubuntu 16 point oh four oh four LCS but
that's just using the regular docker
method how do we get in here via two
routing well we're gonna leave this bash
session open come into a new route
terminal doctor yes shows us that this
is the container ID of that running
instance so this is where the magic
happens and we can dump the root
filesystem it dumps by default to STD
out which is literally the screen output
but you need to redirect that to a file
with the redirect thing so docker export
and the container angey then the
redirect to a file root dot are what we
just did there as we wrote in our
archive of the entire root directory
into that root our file our dash X evita
roots dot R this will extract to my
current working directory which is
fortunately a temp directory i've made
LS again and have a root filesystem from
here it's a standard to root so before I
do - - by dollar sign I slash dot slash
dollar sign I Chi root current working
directory that we're going to mount up
the thing then we're going to ask myself
instead of root environment variables
and we're gonna make sure we're running
the right operating system and just like
that with two rooted into a docker image
anything in a docker repositories is a 2
root potentially so that's pretty cool
thanks for watching
