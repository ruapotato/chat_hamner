hello and welcome today we're taking a
look at whisper large version 3 Turbo
it's open source and you can run it
locally let's take a look this is the
server script it lets me use other
client scripts to connect and use the
whisper model pretty easily here's my
client code it lets me use this handy
little device to push a button uh it's
just a Ada fruit feather and when I push
the button it it uh Records that I've
done that this is a
test okay okay so you can see it's
already pretty fast and it's uh pretty
handy I'm going to go ahead and demo
what it's like to use whisper 3 Turbo
large uh it's a very powerful opsource
local voice translation
system as you can see it's incredibly
powerful and lets me translate my voice
in a live
manner every time I end a sentence I
simply just let go of this
button it makes it really easy for me to
get a perfect voice
translation you can use ASR to do this
sort of uh voice clipping automatically
but it's a little bit more buggy than if
I hold a
button all in all this is crazy
impressive and one of the best most
accurate and speediest voice translation
systems on the
market and it's fully open source check
that out it's only using 12% of my vram
all in all I'm crazy impressed and I'm
sure you could build this out into a
really impressive AI system by attaching
a large language model on the back end
anyway thanks for watching bye
