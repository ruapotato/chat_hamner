I'm gonna start with the best footage
here is the labrum 5bo dink
after we got it to boot we had problem
after problem getting user input into
the development kit after trying a USB
to USB C adapter and even a powered USB
hub it doesn't work I hopped on the
development forums and it turns out we
need a USB C powered hub and at this
point without the screen working with
touch input a USB C hub is the only way
to go unfortunately this means I need to
run to the store and grab myself a USB C
hub I'm planning to play with the
development kit again on Sunday and
hopefully with the USB C hub we'll be
able to play with the interface on the
device as well as test the GSM module
for call and text thanks for watching
bye
