back in the early days of computing the
logic that runs computers was hidden
away and sold only to those that had
enough money this kind of works if you
have a business use case for every
computer but it rightly pissed off a
large number of computer programmers
just wanting to understand modify or
reuse some locked away secret program

Richard Stallman was known for fighting
against software patents and in 1985
started the canoe project by releasing
his call to action now with a fearless
leader chosen we the people started work
towards rewriting what was largely
inaccessible to the general public
while applications make up a large
amount of what computers can do it gets
nowhere without a kernel at the end of
the day the kernel is exposing hardware
to the software the sled software
developers target kernels instead of
individual hardware platforms while the
freedom respecting OS called canoe
started developing its own kernel in
1990 shortly after linus torvalds
started developing his own OS called
freaks which then was renamed to Linux
Linux and canoe merged forces once Linux
took on the GPL license in 1992 anyway
let's take a look at where this all
started to come together HJ loos
bootable root disk for Linux is widely
considered the first distribution this
puppy was built for an AI 386 computer
with a 5.2 inch floppy drive I don't own
any hardware that can run this but we
can emulate this with PC eeehm
you
okay P CEM is not that good at reading
floppies did you know that DOSBox is an
AI 386 emulator I wonder if we can get
this to handle Linux
oh wow Lila I didn't expect that this
brings me back to the days when Celeste
10 was still supported and I worked for
Novell doing SUSE Linux technical
support
I think grub was a lot easier to work
with although I only got a handful of
calls with people using lie low
so it seems DOSBox does not like booting
Linux I'm not sure how motivated those
devs were when it came to hard drive
controllers but it's cool to see the
different error messages from the very
old versions of Linux to the still very
old versions of Linux
I'm not sure why I didn't try qemu first
but this has been installed in my system
for a long time
QEMU had no issue running at all once I
figured out this command
this early operating system looks a lot
like the modern operating system that
powers most of the internet pretty cool
for the earliest thing that you can call
a distro on login you agreed with an
ASCII Bart Simpson this was distributed
on floppies as a bootable root disk you
could install it to a hard drive but
that was targeted towards the more
technically minded this early version of
Linux is a cool sandbox you can play
around in it's interesting to see how
many of the core ideas are already in
place /bin has a bunch of binary
programs these are all command line
based
/hz is full of system settings like FS
tab which contains a list of disks that
need e mounted on boot that's the issue
seems to be the closest thing to a
release file that I'm going to find /dev
looks very similar to how it does today
except the device names aren't as
dynamic they seem to show placeholders
that don't point at real Hardware a lot
of the block devices don't actually seem
to be real devices I'm not sure why I'm
using tty 0 &amp; tty 1
but you can see that computer magic here
is working you can even take notes with
VI just like a lot of modern Linux users
do today
some commands don't work 100% the way I
expected them to tab autocomplete is not
implemented in this shell which does
slow things down quite a bit
Wow proc is empty
switching over to a newer version of
this project we can see there are more
of the files we'd expect to see in slash
Brock the kernels virtual memory map k
core is rather small
I think that's around 64 megabytes in
total this newer version also includes a
few more programs and a few fragmented
help pages
shut down didn't act quite as I was
expecting leaving me with this message
all in all it's very interesting to see
where this minimalistic OS started the
tools included are rather limited but it
seems the only way to install additional
software back in 1992 was to copy source
files and build it yourself the
important takeaway here is this was the
first freedom respecting operating
system made by people for people thanks
for watching bye
