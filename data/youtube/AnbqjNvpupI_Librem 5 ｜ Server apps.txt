we think of phones as a way to consume
services they pull data from across the
world wide web or in some cases your
land in the Android and iOS world a web
connection and in most cases a
proprietary app like YouTube or Netflix
is required to enjoy streaming media but
what if it was the other way around
what if instead of consuming services
your phone instead offered app services
to your land the idea of a personal
cloud is intriguing to me and since the
cloud is largely made up of Linux the
library of software is big these days
it's pretty common to spin up a small
cloud instance and set up a service like
Plex or own cloud or MB and having a
static IP address is definitely a big
plus but this idea of having a mobile
cloud is something I've never really
considered as interesting until now the
Libra 5 is running an OS based on Debian
which is a very good server OS let's
test out running some server-side
software on this phone first up jelly
fan I like the licensing of jelly fan
more than I like MB but I wasn't able to
get jelly fin running on the def kit
fortunately it was rather trivial to get
M be running it was a matter of W
getting the dev file and then simply apt
installing that file
that's it we are now running a server
program on a phone without modification
let's see Android do that the next step
is to connect to the dev kit any device
on the same network will be able to
reach the MB instance here I'm using the
labrum 13 running openSUSE the URL is
simply the phone's IP address colon 80
96 cool we can see the MB initial setup
dialog we're gonna need some kind of
matey to test with so I went ahead and
copied seasons 1 through 3 of next-gen
to an SD card and just a note this is
100% legally owned I'll go ahead and
mount that under /mnt we'll just add the
media folder and let it scan away
turns out it's Kentucky as we try to
play anything
to test I downloaded a dot mp4 file
after rescanning the library it plays
without issue so for whatever reason the
mkv files don't seem to play well or
possibly it was a bad copy but this is a
Debian computer I might as well fix the
issue
locally one small script in a few hours
later all the files are converted
locally to mp4 and they play without
for fun let's stress test this a little
bit here's what it looks like streaming
one connection it did have an initial
hiccup but I didn't see it hiccup ever
again and here's to not much of a
difference
[Music]
and here's three streams running from
the dev kit there is a bit of delay when
you click to a part of the video that
you haven't played yet
it has no problem with three streams
running on the dev kit plus running VLC
locally that is completely nutso for
people can enjoy this phone at the same
time being able to host your own Netflix
like interface plus two terabytes of
micro SD card support this phone can
certainly pack in the entertainment if
you want to be able to upload and
download files Google Drive style Aurora
files is simple to get installed modify
source lists not a repo key apt update
and apt install Aurora files you'll need
to enable a rewire for this to work here
you can enter a new super admin password
and you should create a new user once
logged in as the new user this is a very
basic interface to upload and download
files from your phone pretty cool I
might give ownCloud a try sometime I
think it would be pretty cool to have a
mobile interface to my own Libre meone
email this demonstrates a clear
advantage fork and new Linux / Android
Linux while both can host content the
implementation details looks rather
shitty on Android compared to canoe
Linux I also played a bit with a mobile
hotspot even when I had the death kit
plugged in via ethernet I wasn't able to
connect to the mobile hotspot but it did
show up when I was scanning for Wi-Fi
connections I think a hotspot would be
epic in conjunction with a mobile server
that way you wouldn't need to connect
two devices to the same Wi-Fi you could
potentially share a Wi-Fi connection and
expose your locally running services on
that
thanks for watching bye
