hello everyone after my last deep dive
into Linux mobile phones you all shared
some amazing feedback let's cover some
of the devices I missed and some updates
about the devices I covered last time
the shift Phone 8 is easily one of the
most interesting devices I forgot to
mention in my last video they're
building a modular device with
repairability in mind with over 13 user
replaceable modules and Hardware kill
switches these guys are taking Hardware
repairability to the next level the
device runs an Android 14 based
operating system but it does promise
good ROM support for Linux enthusiasts
out there this device is just begging to
have different operating systems loaded
onto it the Mecha com seems to be taking
a completely different approach their
Hardware already exists instead of
crowdfunding a device that might exist
their crowdfunding is more of a way of
gauging interest I'm not saying
crowdfunding ideas is bad but having a
phone shipped quickly after a crowdfund
would be a huge benefit people are tired
of waiting years for their device I've
also started looking into the software
stack that Mecca is building their build
scripts are written in New Shell their
desktop environment ditches gtk entirely
and is written in Rust really
interesting software stack that's
completely different than fos just a
quick correction from my last video the
flx1 by Fury Labs does apparently have
good T-Mobile support in the USA while I
can't independently verify this I can
say the developers at Fury labs are easy
to get a hold of and more than happy to
answer your questions as long as you're
okay with an Android boot bootstrap
approach to get modern Linux up and
going this is a fantastic option if I
had $550 spare I'd certainly pick up one
of these devices to play with for those
willing to flash their own devices
postmarket OS works really well on the
OnePlus 6 OnePlus 6t and Google pixel 3A
while these aren't out of the- boox
solutions with a little knowhow they
make for a great daily driver Yola
announced a new community phone pretty
exciting for those who are selfish OS
fans out of the box it runs selfish 5
with Android app support it's C by an
octacore arm processor with 8 gigs of
RAM and 128 gigs of storage this is
pretty decently speced for its price if
you're in the USA it's always smart to
check the LTE bands to make sure that
it'll actually work on your cell carrier
from the modular design of the shift
Phone 8 to Yola's new community device
the mobile Linux landscape is really
heating up in 2025 thanks for watching
bye
